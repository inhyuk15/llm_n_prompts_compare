1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code largely adheres to the guidelines for controlling code complexity. All functions contain five or fewer parameters, which complies with the parameter count limit. The cyclomatic complexity appears to be moderate and functions are generally divided appropriately ensuring clarity. However, some functions do not maintain the maximum allowed nesting depth of 4, and a few functions potentially exceed 50 lines in length, which violates the guidelines. Overall, there is room for reducing nesting in certain functions and dividing longer functions further for cleaner complexity management.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The functions such as parse_int, extract_tokens, and process_input_line exhibit straightforward control flow without excessive branching or deeply nested conditions, indicating cyclomatic complexity remains below 10 per function.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The function extract_tokens contains nested loops and conditionals nesting deeper than 4 levels visible from conditional blocks combined with loops. Similarly, handle_valid_transaction contains nested if-else and blocks, possibly exceeding nesting level 4. To fix, refactor complex conditionals into smaller helper functions to reduce nesting levels.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The function extract_tokens and handle_valid_transaction approximate or exceed 50 lines; for example, extract_tokens has many nested loops and conditionals spanning multiple lines, as does handle_valid_transaction with embedded formatting blocks. To comply, split these into smaller sub-functions performing discrete tasks.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions have five or fewer parameters. For example, extract_tokens has 5 parameters, process_input_line has zero parameters, and others have fewer, satisfying the parameter count rule.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code structure is generally modular with small parameter lists per function, which is positive for maintainability. Nevertheless, the nesting depth and function length guidelines are not fully respected in some functions, increasing complexity and hindering readability. Excessive nesting risks making logic harder to track and modify. Refactoring larger functions such as extract_tokens and handle_valid_transaction into smaller, well-named helper functions will improve clarity and maintain compliance with complexity limits. Addressing these issues will reduce potential error risks and facilitate future maintenance.
