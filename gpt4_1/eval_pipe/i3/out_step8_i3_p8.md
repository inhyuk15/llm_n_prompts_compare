Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 이미 코드 formatting 및 naming 규칙이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 작성  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Project-specific formatting and naming rules are not provided; unable to verify application of existing rules.

Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 naming 규칙이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일을 적용하여 formatting및 naming 규칙 적용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code consistently uses Google C/C++ style conventions including snake_case for functions and variables, constants use 'k' prefix with CamelCase, braces and indentation follow Google style, and comments use proper Doxygen-style formatting.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
- The code is uniformly formatted with consistent indentation, spacing, and naming conventions, minimizing readability issues.  
- Constant naming uses 'k' prefix (e.g., kLedPin), matching Google style recommendations for constants; types and variables use snake_case (e.g., product_t, money_len), indicating good adherence.  
- Comment style is consistent and clear, with Doxygen-style annotations supporting maintainability.  
- A minor ambiguity exists regarding the presence of any project-specific formatting or naming rules; since none were provided, this aspect is marked as REVIEW.  
- Overall, the code demonstrates strong compliance with the naming and formatting guidelines specified, with no critical violations noted.
