1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code largely satisfies the memory safety guidelines through the use of static allocation for all buffers and variables, strict boundary checks for input parsing, and minimization of global variables with limited scope using the static keyword. Stack usage is estimated and documented in the setup comments. However, certain items lack precise explicit stack usage comments per function, and boundary checks, though generally present, could be clarified in some parsing steps. Overall, the code demonstrates good compliance with the safety guidelines with minor areas needing clarification or enhancement.

Total items: 5  
Pass: 3  
Fail: 0  
Review: 2  
Compliance Rate: 60.00 %

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All buffers (input_buffer, money_str, product_str) are statically allocated. Products array and LCD objects are static or const, with no dynamic allocation observed.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Stack usage estimation is only commented in setup() as a general description; there is no per-function explicit stack usage calculation or annotation.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Only the setup function has a general stack usage comment but no detailed per-function stack usage comments, especially for loop() where main buffers are used.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Input reading limits to buffer sizes; length checks before copying substrings; parse_int performs digit validation and overflow protection; snprintf uses fixed buffer sizes with truncation to prevent overflow.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Global variables are minimized and declared static to restrict scope within the translation unit, including buffers and product arrays.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

While the code successfully applies static allocation and boundary checks preventing buffer overruns, the lack of detailed per-function stack usage comments limits traceability for memory footprint assurance, especially in the loop function which processes all input. Documenting stack usage explicitly per function would strengthen compliance and maintainability. All global variables are scoped tightly with static, fulfilling scope restriction best practices. The parsing logic is robust, preventing invalid input and integer overflow, minimizing risks of undefined behavior. No dynamic memory allocations or unsafe memory operations are noted. The code exemplifies strong practices for embedded systems memory safety with room for improvement in documentation detail.
