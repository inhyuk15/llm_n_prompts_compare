1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates a consistent error code system using an enum type 'ErrorCode_t' that covers various error scenarios. Each function that can fail returns an error code, and error propagation is explicit and controlled. Fail-safe default values are utilized (e.g., -1 initialization), and error handling distinguishes between recoverable errors (such as invalid inputs) and fatal errors (such as LCD failures). However, some improvements in error propagation clarity, consolidation of recovery versus fatal error handling, and consistent use of error codes in every function could be enhanced.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계가 있다면 그것을 따르며 없다면 enum 사용하여 통일된 에러처리를 하도록 함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code consistently uses 'ErrorCode_t' enum for error codes, covering all error cases, fulfilling the uniform error code system requirement.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Most functions that can fail return 'ErrorCode_t', but 'process_input_line(void)' and 'setup(void)', 'loop(void)' return void and do not directly return error codes. Clarification is needed on whether these need to return error codes to fully comply.

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Error codes returned from functions such as 'read_serial_input', 'extract_tokens', 'parse_int', and 'handle_valid_transaction' are checked and propagated explicitly with appropriate handling or return.

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Variables like 'money' and 'prod_num' are initialized to -1 indicating invalid state, which allows detection of uninitialized or failed parsing and safe handling of error cases.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code distinguishes recoverable errors like invalid input or insufficient money (with specific error codes and messages) from fatal errors like LCD failures or unknown errors, which cause more immediate failure handling.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The uniform use of the 'ErrorCode_t' enum is a strong point for clarity and maintainability.  
- Error propagation within critical functions is handled properly with explicit checks and returns, minimizing silent failures.  
- The code uses default fail-safe initializations which help to avoid undefined behaviors on error.  
- The distinction between recoverable and fatal errors is implemented logically, assisting in appropriate error responses.  
- However, the top-level 'process_input_line' and main Arduino 'loop' and 'setup' functions do not return error codes; while they handle errors internally, this deviation from returning error status in all functions may require clarification for full compliance.  
- Some redundancy in critical section management and delay-wait with error display can be reviewed for simplification but does not violate the guidelines.  
- Overall, the error handling approach is systematic but would benefit from uniform function signatures in terms of error reporting.

Final compliance percentage is 80.00%.
