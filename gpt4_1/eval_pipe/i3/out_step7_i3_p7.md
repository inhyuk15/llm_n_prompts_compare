1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code exhibits extensive and consistent documentation using the Google standard C/C++ style, as no existing project-specific style was indicated. All major types, functions, constants, and buffers have appropriate Doxygen-style comments explaining purpose, parameters, return values, and internal logic, fulfilling the requirement for systematic code documentation. There is no evidence of missing or insufficient comments for critical sections or API functions.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 코드에 체계적인 문서화를 추가하세요 - 프로젝트에 이미 코드 문서화 스타일이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 주석 작성  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The guideline requires applying existing project-specific documentation style if present; however, no information about an existing style in the project was provided, so it cannot be confirmed if an existing style was followed or identified.

Guideline_Item: 코드에 체계적인 문서화를 추가하세요 - 프로젝트에 문서화 스타일이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일 적용하여 주석 작성  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code is comprehensively documented with Doxygen-style comments resembling the Google C/C++ style, covering enums, structs, global/static variables, and all functions with descriptions for parameters and return values. Comments include doc tags like @brief, @param, @return appropriately, confirming adherence to Google style.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The code employs clear and consistent documentation, which reflects careful attention to maintainability and clarity, crucial in mission-critical software environments.  
- Inline code comments, descriptive identifiers, and structured Doxygen annotations provide sufficient explanatory context without ambiguity.  
- No functions or constants lack comments, minimizing the risk of misunderstandings or misuse by future maintainers or during audits.  
- The only uncertainty is whether a project-specific documentation style exists; this prevents definitive audit on adherence to a pre-existing style but the fallback to the Google standard style is plainly evidenced.  
- Overall, proper documentation reduces risks associated with code comprehension errors or maintenance difficulties.
