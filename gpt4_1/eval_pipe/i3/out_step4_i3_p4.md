1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates partial application of defensive programming techniques. It includes pointer NULL checks via assert in some functions, input range validations, and buffer boundary checks. However, some pointer parameters lack NULL checks, assert() usage is inconsistent, and integer overflow/underflow checks are not comprehensively enforced. Overall, the implementation is moderately compliant but requires improvements concerning uniform pointer validations, complete assert coverage, and rigorous integer overflow handling.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 포인터 매개변수 NULL 검사  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Only some pointer parameters are checked with assert (e.g., parse_int, extract_tokens), others that can be pointer parameters such as lcd_printf_fixed’s 'str' parameter or print_error_and_wait’s 'msg' parameter are only conditionally checked by if-statements instead of assert. Consistent thorough NULL validation for all pointer parameters is not fully applied.

Guideline_Item: 함수 입력 범위 검증  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions validate input ranges adequately, e.g., parse_int checks string length and digits, extract_tokens checks substring lengths, handle_valid_transaction asserts product index ranges, and process_input_line validates parsed integer ranges before transaction. Range validations appear systematically applied.

Guideline_Item: assert()로 사전/사후 조건 명시  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Asserts primarily appear to check pointer NULL in some functions and some input range conditions in handle_valid_transaction. Many other preconditions or postconditions lack asserts, for example input parameters in lcd_printf_fixed only partially asserted (col, row but not fmt pointer beyond NULL check with if), and output buffer bounds postconditions are unchecked. The usage of assert() is partial, not comprehensive.

Guideline_Item: 배열 인덱스 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Array accesses use validated indices, e.g., product index uses assert and bounds checks, buffers have length constraints checked, string copies are carefully guarded to not exceed buffer sizes, and loops limit iterations by buffer sizes. No unguarded array accesses seen.

Guideline_Item: 정수 오버플로우/언더플로우 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: parse_int function includes explicit checks preventing overflow before multiplying and adding digits. handle_valid_transaction checks that money >= price before calculating change to avoid underflow. No evident unchecked integer overflow/underflow paths.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code follows many defensive programming practices, particularly buffer size checks and input range validations. However, pointer NULL checks are inconsistent—some parameters checked via assert(), others only by simple if conditions or omitted. The sparse use of assert limits early failure detection and correctness guarantees. Expanding assert usage for all critical preconditions and postconditions would improve robustness. The integer overflow checking is effectively handled in parsing and arithmetic operations relevant to payments and change calculation. The array bounds are well controlled, minimizing risks of out-of-bounds errors. Overall, enhancing pointer validation uniformity and assert coverage would elevate code safety compliance.
