1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code implements multiple defensive programming techniques aligned with the guidelines. It checks all pointer parameters for NULL where applicable, conducts input range validations for function parameters, uses assert() to specify pre/post conditions, performs array index bounds checking, and includes some integer overflow/underflow checks in fee calculations. However, some pointer NULL checks are omitted (e.g., in printRemainingSlots), a few functions do not assert all input conditions explicitly, and integer overflow checks could be more consistent. Overall compliance is strong but with minor gaps that need addressing.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 포인터 매개변수 NULL 검사  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: While parseTime() and showTemporaryLCD() check pointer parameters for NULL (using if or assert), functions like printRemainingSlots(), processLine() (except assert for line), and others do not validate pointer parameters such as lcd.print() inputs or other pointers. For example, printRemainingSlots() uses a local buffer but does not check pointers passed to lcd.print(). To fix, ensure all functions that accept pointer arguments verify NULL before dereferencing.

Guideline_Item: 함수 입력 범위 검증  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code consistently checks input ranges for hour, minute, and parking slot indices. For example, calculateFee() rejects invalid hour/minute ranges, processEntry() and processExit() assert valid time inputs, and parseTime() validates input times. The checks prevent invalid values as per the guideline.

Guideline_Item: assert()로 사전/사후 조건 명시  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Relevant functions use assert() effectively, e.g., parkedCarsCount() asserts count within bounds, processEntry() and processExit() assert valid hour/minute ranges, findOldestParkedCarIndex() asserts index validity, and snprintf results are asserted for correctness.

Guideline_Item: 배열 인덱스 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Array indices are always validated or bounded within loops. For example, iterations using i < MAX_CARS ensure indices are within valid range. Assertions also confirm validity of returned indices like oldestIdx.

Guideline_Item: 정수 오버플로우/언더플로우 검사  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The code includes overflow checks in calculateFee() for multiplication and addition operations on hours and fees but does not consistently check for underflows or integer wraparounds in all arithmetic, nor in other parts such as decrementing counters. Further details on integer bounds for all arithmetic operations and unsigned vs signed conversions are needed to fully assess compliance.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code employs strong defensive programming practices overall, especially in input validation and assertion usage which support runtime correctness. However, pointer parameter null-checking is inconsistently applied. Some functions rely on assert() which may be disabled in production builds; runtime NULL checks are preferable when pointers come from external sources. The integer overflow checks in calculateFee() are thorough for that function but less so elsewhere. Also, the use of assert() for checking snprintf return values is correct but could benefit from error-handling fallback to avoid silent failures. Strengthening pointer validation and expanding integer arithmetic guards would enhance robustness and compliance.
