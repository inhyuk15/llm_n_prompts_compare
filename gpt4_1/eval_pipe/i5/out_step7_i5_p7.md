1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The submitted code applies Google Standard C/C++ style for comments consistently throughout all functions, structs, and enums, aligning with the guideline that requires systematic documentation with project style or Google style if none exists. Function headers use Doxygen-style tags (@brief, @param, @return), which clearly describe functionality and parameters. However, some smaller helper functions and interrupt critical sections lack explicit documentation comments, and inline comments for complex code logic are minimal. Overall, the code meets the documentation guideline requirements satisfactorily.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 코드에 체계적인 문서화를 추가하세요 - 프로젝트에 이미 코드 문서화 스타일이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 주석 작성  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The entire code uses Google Standard C/C++ style documentation uniformly, including Doxygen-style function headers and detailed comments on structs and enums.

Guideline_Item: 코드에 체계적인 문서화를 추가하세요 - 프로젝트에 문서화 스타일이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일 적용하여 주석 작성  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Since no prior style was specified, the code follows Google Standard C/C++ style per guideline, with comprehensive Doxygen-style comments on all major elements.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code exhibits strong adherence to structured documentation best practices with descriptive function headers and consistently formatted comments that facilitate maintenance and auditing. While all key components are documented, minor utility functions such as trimWhitespace lack explicit header comments. Additionally, the code could benefit from more inline comments explaining complex logic decisions and interrupt disabling critical regions, providing better clarity for future developers or auditors. These enhancements would improve traceability but do not currently breach the documentation guideline provided.
