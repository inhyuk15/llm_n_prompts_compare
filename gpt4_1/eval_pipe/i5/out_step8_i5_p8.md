2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX  

Guideline_Item: 코드 작성시 일관된 formatting과 naming 규칙을 적용하세요 - 프로젝트에 이미 코드 formatting 및 naming 규칙이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 작성, 프로젝트에 naming 규칙이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일을 적용하여 formatting및 naming 규칙 적용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code follows consistent formatting and naming using uppercase with underscores for macro constants (e.g., MAX_CARS), lowercase_with_underscores for variable and function names (e.g., parked_cars_count, process_entry), and consistent indentation and spacing aligned with Google C/C++ style guide as no project-specific rules are present.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

No systemic issues or inconsistencies in formatting or naming patterns are detected. The code uses descriptive names, consistent casing conventions, and logical grouping of code elements. Proper commenting style for functions and types is employed. This compliance reduces maintainability risks and supports code readability across the project.
