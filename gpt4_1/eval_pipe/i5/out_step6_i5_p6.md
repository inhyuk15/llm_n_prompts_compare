1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code implements a centralized error code enumeration (ErrorCode) used consistently across multiple functions, ensuring unified error handling. Every function that can encounter errors returns an ErrorCode indicating success or specific failure reasons, satisfying the error status return requirement. Error propagation is clear because each function returns these codes, and callers handle them accordingly. Defensive default/fail-safe values are set for outputs upon errors, such as setting fee to zero on calculation errors or count to zero on invalid counts. The code also distinguishes recoverable errors (e.g., invalid arguments, parking full) from more critical conditions (e.g., data errors, not found). Overall, the implementation aligns well with the provided guidelines.

Total items: 5

Compliance Rate: 100.00 %

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계를 따르거나 enum으로 통일된 에러처리  
Status: PASS  
Reason: An enum ErrorCode defines all error codes; all error returns use this enum consistently.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All relevant functions including parkedCarsCount, calculateFee, processEntry, findOldestParkedCarIndex, processExit return ErrorCode values indicating error states.

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions propagate error codes to callers who handle or branch logic accordingly (e.g., processLine checking errors from processEntry/processExit).

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions set outputs to safe default values on error, e.g., calculateFee sets *fee=0 on error, parkedCarsCount sets *count=0 on invalid count.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Error codes differentiate recoverable errors like ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT, ERR_PARKING_FULL, and more critical states like ERR_NOT_FOUND or ERR_TIME_INVALID, and code branches accordingly.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The system demonstrates a robust and disciplined error handling framework using enumerated error codes, facilitating maintainability and clarity. Defensive programming is apparent through fail-safe default settings which prevent unexpected behavior on error. Error propagation and handling patterns ensure that upper layers are informed of failure modes, allowing for appropriate user feedback or recovery. No deviations from the guidelines were identified, indicating strong compliance with the specified error handling requirements.
