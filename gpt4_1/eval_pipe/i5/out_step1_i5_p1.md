1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code largely complies with the memory safety guidelines through static allocation of all variables and clear stack usage comments per function. It incorporates boundary checks against buffer overruns and minimizes global variable scope by using static declarations. However, some minor issues include the lack of explicit stack usage comments for a few functions and reliance on certain assumptions like null-terminated inputs without explicit verification in all contexts.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All arrays and data structures such as parkingSlots and inputLine are statically allocated globally or as static local variables. No dynamic (heap) allocation is present.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: While some functions (parkedCarsCount, calculateFee, printStatus, processLine, loop) include stack usage comments describing local variables and buffer sizes, this is inconsistent across all functions. For example, the 'setup' function and certain small functions lack explicit stack usage comments. Clarification is required if all functions must uniformly contain such comments.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Not all functions have explicit comments about the stack usage. For instance, 'setup' and 'loop' functions’ comments partially cover stack usage, but 'setup' lacks such comment entirely, violating the guideline that all functions should have stack usage comments. To fix, add explicit stack usage comments to every function, especially 'setup'.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Input reading in 'loop' uses bounds checks on inputLine size (max 32 chars + null), and string formatting in 'printStatus' and 'processLine' use snprintf with buffer size limits. This protects against buffer overflows effectively.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All global variables are declared static limiting their scope to the file. No non-static global variables exist.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code exhibits a strong pattern of static allocation, minimizing dynamic and global memory usage risks. Careful bounds checking in input processing and string formatting enhances memory safety. The inclusion of stack usage comments in some critical functions is a positive practice, but inconsistency reduces clarity for maintainers and auditability. Uniform adherence to stack usage commenting per function, including setup and the main loop, is recommended for full compliance. The code assumes input strings are null-terminated properly before processing, which is a safe assumption here given the controlled input reading logic. Overall risk of buffer overflow or stack misuse is low thanks to these measures.
