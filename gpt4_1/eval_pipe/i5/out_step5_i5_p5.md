1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code partially demonstrates compliance with the multi-tasking safety guidelines. It uses volatile for shared variables and disables interrupts to create critical sections protecting access to shared resources, which covers some synchronization aspects. However, the use of interrupts disabling in potentially lengthy code sections and the possibility of race conditions due to insufficient reentrancy and lack of atomic operations reduce its robustness. Overall, the code requires improvements in atomicity assurance and reentrancy for full compliance.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 공유 자원에 volatile 키워드 사용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The ParkingSlot structure’s shared members occupied, in_hour, in_minute, and fee are declared as volatile, as seen in the definition of parkingSlots array and struct fields.  

Guideline_Item: 환경에 Critical section 식별 및 보호 매커니즘이 있다면 사용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code disables interrupts via noInterrupts()/interrupts() around sections that access the shared parkingSlots array and related counters, providing critical section protection against concurrent access in the interrupt context environment.

Guideline_Item: 재진입 가능한 함수로 변경  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Functions such as processEntry, processExit, and parkedCarsCount disable interrupts globally while iterating over shared data, including calls to Serial.print, delay, and lcd functions that are blocking and potentially long. This design is not reentrant and may cause deadlocks or priority inversion; critical sections should be minimized and non-blocking for reentrancy.

Guideline_Item: 원자적 연산 보장  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Although volatile is used, multiple shared variable updates (e.g., setting parkingSlots[i].occupied and related fields) are done in multi-statement sequences within a single critical section but without finer atomic operations or locks. The disabling of interrupts ensures some atomicity but on an overly broad scope. There is no use of atomic operations or hardware atomic instructions.

Guideline_Item: Race condition 발생 여지가 없도록 방지  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The parkingSlots shared data is accessed and modified under interrupt disable protection, but the critical sections include multiple non-atomic statements, and scan loops with interrupts disabled may block high-priority interrupts too long. Also, volatile alone does not guarantee race-free access in multi-core or preemptive RTOS environments. The code lacks explicit mutexes or atomic APIs, so race conditions may still occur in certain execution contexts.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code correctly identifies shared resources and uses the volatile keyword and interrupt disabling to protect critical sections. This is a common approach in low-level embedded systems without an RTOS. However, the critical sections are often too broad, containing calls to blocking functions such as Serial printing, delay(), and LCD operations, which can violate real-time constraints and reduce system responsiveness. These should be minimized strictly to only code that manipulates shared data, and longer operations deferred outside critical sections. No use of reentrancy-safe design patterns like locking primitives or atomic operations is present. The code assumes a single-core microcontroller environment and that interrupts disabling is sufficient. If multi-threading or preemptive scheduling is introduced, this approach would fail. The recommendation is to refactor critical sections to be as small and fast as possible, avoid blocking calls inside them, implement true atomic operations if supported, and design functions to be reentrant or protected via mutexes in complex systems. This is critical to fully prevent race conditions and guarantee safe multi-tasking behavior.
