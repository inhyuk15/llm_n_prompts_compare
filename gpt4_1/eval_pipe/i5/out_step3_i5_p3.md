1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates well-organized functions, each clearly scoped with focused responsibilities. All functions have five or fewer parameters, respecting the parameter limit, and no function exceeds 50 lines. However, the code lacks explicit cyclomatic complexity metrics, and from reading the control structures, certain functions (e.g., processEntry, processExit) likely have cyclomatic complexity higher than 10 and possibly nested control structures exceeding 4 levels. Consequently, the complexity and nesting level requirements are not fully met, affecting maintainability.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Functions like processEntry and processExit contain multiple conditional branches (if-else) and loops, likely resulting in cyclomatic complexity above 10. The code does not demonstrate splitting into smaller functions to reduce complexity.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Nested blocks deeper than 4 levels exist, notably in processEntry and processExit functions (e.g., loops containing conditionals within conditionals). No evidence shows limiting or refactoring to reduce nesting.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions, including complex ones like processEntry and processExit, do not exceed 50 lines based on the provided code.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No function in code uses more than 5 parameters; most have zero to two parameters.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code exhibits reasonable structural decomposition with clearly defined functions and adherence to line count and parameter limits, promoting readability. However, the absence of explicit cyclomatic complexity reduction limits maintainability. Functions handling core logic like processEntry and processExit would benefit from further decomposition to reduce complexity and nesting depth. Excessive nesting can increase error-proneness and complicate testing. Addressing these issues by modularizing complex conditional blocks into smaller functions and using return-early patterns will enhance code quality and compliance with guidelines.
