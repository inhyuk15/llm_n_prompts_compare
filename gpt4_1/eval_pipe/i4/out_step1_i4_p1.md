1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code shows sound static allocation practices for structures and limits global variable scope by using static declarations. Stack usages in functions are commented with approximate byte sizes and local variables remain small arrays or scalars, supporting stack safety. Boundary checks are implemented in elevator movement and floor validity conditions. However, the queue for GPIO events is dynamically allocated via xQueueCreate without static allocation, violating static memory allocation requirements. Minor inconsistencies in direction setting and some missing boundary checks in elevator movement conditions reduce robustness. Also, the static keyword is redundantly doubled on some declarations and should be corrected. Overall, the code mostly respects memory safety but requires fixes for dynamic allocation and stricter boundary validations to fully comply.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The GPIO event queue is created dynamically via xQueueCreate, which does not guarantee static allocation. The comment notes static allocation is not used. To comply, replace xQueueCreate with static queue creation APIs or pre-allocated buffer with xQueueCreateStatic.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function handling stack usage includes comments specifying approximate stack sizes (e.g., ~32 bytes for move_elevator_one_step, ~40 bytes for lcd_update, ~16 bytes for button_task), demonstrating stack usage awareness.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions include explicit comments describing estimated stack usage in bytes, meeting this requirement.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: While floor range checks are performed prior to elevator assignment or selection, the move_elevator_one_step function relies on conditions (e.g. current_floor < FLOOR_COUNT) without further explicit checks to prevent overflow if unexpected values occur. Additionally, in button_task, floor is reassigned without extra validation for negative or out-of-range input after switch-case, though initial switch sets it safely. For full compliance, stronger boundary checking and defensive programming around floor variables is recommended to prevent buffer overruns or invalid memory access.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Global variables elevators, gpio_evt_queue, and lcd are declared static restricting their scope. No non-static global variables are present, minimizing global exposure as per guidelines.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code demonstrates good practices in reducing global scope, using static for global variables and adding stack usage comments in functions indicating stack memory awareness. Static allocation of data structures like elevators and lcd handle contributes to memory safety. However, the main dynamic memory allocation point is the GPIO event queue created dynamically using xQueueCreate rather than a static queue creation method. This use of dynamic allocation is a critical violation in systems requiring strict static allocation for safety.

Buffer overflow protections are mostly in place with floor number validations before elevator assignments, but certain functions could enforce stricter bounds to handle unexpected or corrupted inputs. For example, move_elevator_one_step manipulates floors with conditions that presume valid floor values without explicit assertive boundary checks. Adding explicit range validation or asserts would strengthen robustness.

The code contains redundant 'static static' declarations which is syntactically incorrect and should be corrected to a single 'static' keyword to avoid compilation warnings or errors.

Overall, refining dynamic allocation usage, clarifying boundary checks, and code cleanup for static declarations will elevate the code to full compliance with stringent memory safety policies required in mission-critical embedded systems.
