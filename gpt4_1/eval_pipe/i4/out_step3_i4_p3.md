1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code generally adheres to complexity-related guidelines by structuring many small helper functions with clear responsibilities, well within complexity limits. Functions observed have limited nested depth, low parameter counts, and no functions exceed 50 lines. However, an explicit cyclomatic complexity count per function was not provided; some functions like find_closest_elevator contain multiple conditional branches that may approach or exceed complexity thresholds and should be verified. Overall, the code demonstrates reasonable compliance with complexity constraints, but a manual cyclomatic complexity analysis may be beneficial for edge cases.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX  

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The code does not provide explicit cyclomatic complexity metrics. Some functions like find_closest_elevator and process_floor_request contain multiple conditionals that could be near or beyond 10, but no formal complexity measurements are present. A manual or automated cyclomatic complexity report is needed to confirm compliance.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The deepest nested conditional blocks observed in all functions do not exceed 4 levels of nesting. For example, move_elevator_one_step has up to 3 levels of nested if-else blocks; others are flatter.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions in the code are well below 50 lines. Even the longest functions like find_closest_elevator and button_task are concise and under this threshold.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions have 0 to 3 parameters at most. No function exceeds the maximum parameter count of 5.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
The code demonstrates good modular design with many small utility functions, which inherently limits complexity and facilitates maintenance. The use of clear naming and helper functions reduces complexity concentration. However, the absence of explicit cyclomatic complexity measurement is a gap for compliance validation. Functions with conditional branches, such as find_closest_elevator, may risk complexity overshoot and should be checked with static analysis tools. No functions were found violating nesting or length rules. There is a uniform pattern of adhering to parameter count limits. To fully meet guidelines, a cyclomatic complexity report or tool-based verification would be required.
