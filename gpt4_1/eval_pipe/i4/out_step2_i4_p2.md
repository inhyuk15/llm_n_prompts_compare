1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates effective use of named constants and a structured approach to elevator control, complying with several MISRA-C 2012 Mandatory rules. However, there are notable violations including implicit type conversions, absence of a single function exit point, improper handling of logical operator side-effects, and some inadequate switch-case default handling, which impact full compliance. Overall, the code requires modifications to ensure full adherence to the specified MISRA-C 2012 Mandatory rules.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.1: 적절한 operator 활용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Operators are used correctly with proper explicit comparisons and no misuse detected (e.g., use of != 0 for boolean checks).

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.3: 암묵적 타입 변환 제거  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Implicit type conversions occur, for example in "const uint32_t gpio_num = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)arg;" in gpio_isr_handler (pointer to integer cast), and in assigning boolean results to BaseType_t and comparing signed and unsigned types without explicit casts. These should be made explicit or revised to avoid implicit conversions.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.4: 필수 타입 모델 준수  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Usage of fixed width integer types (int32_t, uint32_t) and unsigned suffixes (U) follows a consistent and compliant type model.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.1: 모든 switch문에 default 케이스 추가  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All switch statements (e.g., in button_task) include a default case.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.4: 모든 경로에 break  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All switch cases include break statements; no fall-through paths detected.

Guideline_Item: Rule 15.5: 함수는 단일 exit point (return문 하나)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Multiple functions have multiple return points, e.g., move_elevator_one_step has an early return on null pointer; find_closest_elevator has multiple returns; gpio_isr_handler returns early implicitly; to comply, restructure with single exit and use a local return variable.

Guideline_Item: Rule 13.5: 논리 연산자 &&, || 의 우항에 부작용 금지  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Logical expressions with short-circuit operators include side effects in right-hand operand, e.g. in find_closest_elevator:  
"(dist == best_dist) && (elevators[i].moving == 0) && (elevators[best].moving != 0)" are pure comparisons, no side effects, good; BUT in gpio_isr_handler:  
"xQueueSendFromISR(gpio_evt_queue, &gpio_num, &xHigherPriorityTaskWoken);" then checking "if (xHigherPriorityTaskWoken != pdFALSE)" implies side effect risk related to the flag and yield call. This is borderline but in ISR context and allowed by FreeRTOS usage. Given ambiguity, needs review or redesign.

Guideline_Item: Rule 8.7: Magic number를 명명된 상수로 변경 (0, 1 제외)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Several magic numbers appear such as "4" (number of floors) hardcoded in comparisons inside move_elevator_one_step (e.g., "if (e->current_floor < FLOOR_COUNT)" is good, but "if(e->current_floor < FLOOR_COUNT)" is okay; however, in find_closest_elevator "best_dist = (FLOOR_COUNT * FLOOR_COUNT) + 1;" uses a literal "+1" magic number. Also in snprintf call format strings, literal numbers embedded ("E1:F%d M%d  E2:F%d M%d") are acceptable; however, usage of constants or macros for these literals (such as default target values like 0) is absent in places, e.g., "floor = 0;" could be defined as a named constant. This violates the guideline.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code commendably avoids magic numbers for physical constants by defining named constants for buttons, elevator count, and floor count, which improves maintainability and clarity.

Multiple return points per function reduce traceability and complicate control flow analysis; restructuring functions to have a single return would enhance compliance and testability.

Implicit pointer to integer casts and possible implicit sign conversions constitute undefined or questionable behavior; explicit casting or type-safe design should be applied.

The ISR handler logic with FreeRTOS yield based on priority escalation is typical but may conflict with MISRA-C 13.5. A review or additional comments explaining this controlled exception should be considered.

Overall, the major focus should be on fixing implicit conversions, refactoring functions to single exit points, replacing magic numbers with named constants, and reviewing logical expressions with respect to side-effects in conditional operators to achieve full MISRA-C 2012 Mandatory compliance.
