1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates strong adherence to memory safety guidelines by utilizing static allocation for variables, limiting stack usage, and providing stack usage comments on functions. It correctly restricts global variables with static scope. However, it fails to implement explicit boundary checks to prevent buffer overflow when reading user input with fgets and lacks runtime validations on input buffer sizes beyond fgets limitations.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Static allocation is used for all buffers and variables, e.g., `static char input_buf[16]` and `static float stop_time` and `walk_time` in app_main, with no dynamic memory allocation observed.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each static function declares approximate stack usage in comments such as 32 bytes or 64 bytes. Local variables are minimal, and stack footprint is reasonably controlled.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Every static function has a stack usage comment block immediately above its definition, e.g., `Stack usage: ~48 bytes (int i, cycles variables)`.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: While `fgets` is correctly limited by buffer size, there is no explicit check ensuring inputs fit within `input_buf` beyond `fgets` behavior. Further, `sscanf` usage does not guard against malformed inputs that could cause undefined behavior, and no additional bounds validation or sanitization is performed before processing. To fix, add explicit buffer size validation after input, and consider input validation functions to ensure no overflow occurs.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All global variables are limited by static scope; no global variables with external linkage are used.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code effectively minimizes stack and heap usage by utilizing static allocation and annotating stack usage per function. This mitigates risks related to stack overflow and uncontrolled memory growth. Moreover, restricting global variable scope via static keyword improves encapsulation and reduces unintended side effects.

The primary risk is the lack of explicit boundary checks on user input beyond the use of `fgets`. Although `fgets` is bounded by buffer size, without verification of input length or potential newline presence, buffer misuse or unexpected behavior could occur, especially if input is malformed. Robust input validation and sanitization should be implemented to fully meet memory safety criteria and buffer overflow prevention guidelines.
