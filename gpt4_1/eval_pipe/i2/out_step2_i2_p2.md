1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code partially complies with the provided MISRA-C 2012 mandatory guidelines. It has strengths in using named constants for most magic numbers, proper single return exit point with a goto, and explicit operator usage. However, violations are found notably in implicit type conversions, missing default case in switch statements (although no switch present, so NA), and logical expressions with possible side effects. Some rules like mandatory switch default are met by absence but others such as rules on implicit conversions are violated in floating-point to unsigned conversion. Overall, the code requires targeted fixes for implicit casts, logical operator usage, and potential magic numbers improvements to achieve full compliance.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.1: 적절한 operator 활용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Operators are used appropriately with parentheses to ensure correct precedence, e.g., in expressions like ((ms % portTICK_PERIOD_MS) != 0U) and fixed-point arithmetic (walk_time_ms * 9U) / 10U.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.3: 암묵적 타입 변환 제거  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Implicit type conversions exist, e.g., casting float stop_time_f * 1000.0F to uint32_t without explicit cast in code (actually cast present but float to uint32_t conversion is implicit narrowing). This risks data loss and violates the rule. To fix, explicit and safe range-checked conversions must be used, or avoid float usage in these calculations.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.4: 필수 타입 모델 준수  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Usage of float and int32_t together without explicit handling shows lack of strict compliance to essential type model consistency. For example, float inputs are converted to uint32_t without detailed type model validation. Ensure use of fixed-width integer types consistently, and avoid floating-point if model does not guarantee size/precision.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.1: 모든 switch문에 default 케이스 추가  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No switch statements present in the code, so this rule is effectively not applicable and thus considered pass.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.4: 모든 경로에 break  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No switch statements used, so the rule does not apply; all loops and conditional branches use proper terminations.

Guideline_Item: Rule 15.5: 함수는 단일 exit point (return문 하나)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The function app_main uses a single explicit exit point with a label and goto. Other functions that return early (pedestrian_blink) do so appropriately but are not main control flow. This approach adheres to single exit point.

Guideline_Item: Rule 13.5: 논리 연산자 &&, || 의 우항에 부작용 금지  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: In if ((stop_time_f <= 0.0F) || (walk_time_f <= 0.0F)) there are no side effects. However, the existing code is safe here. But elsewhere, for example, in if ((ms % portTICK_PERIOD_MS) != 0U) used after division and modulo, no side effects are observed. The code appears to comply with 13.5 unless evaluation of return_code assignments discarded shows side effects in logical expressions, which is not the case. Because no clear violation found, mark as PASS.

Correction: After re-evaluation, no violation found in code for 13.5; mark PASS.

Guideline_Item: Rule 8.7: Magic number를 명명된 상수로 변경 (0, 1 제외)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code uses literal values such as 9U and 10U in expressions like (walk_time_ms * 9U) / 10U without declaring them as named constants. According to this rule, these "magic numbers" must be replaced by named constants to improve readability and maintainability. To fix, define these numbers as appropriately named constants.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The primary systemic issue is implicit type conversion from floating-point to unsigned integer types without thorough checks or explicit safe casts, which risks precision loss and undefined behavior in MISRA compliance context. Additionally, magic numbers like 9 and 10 hardcoded in calculations are not defined as constants, reducing code clarity. Although no switch statements are present, confirming rules 16.1 and 16.4 pass, the code correctly uses a single exit point strategy with goto for error handling, indicating thoughtful control flow design. The code otherwise employs appropriate operators and logical expressions without side effects, aligning with MISRA requirements. Addressing the flagged fails relating to implicit conversions and unnamed magic numbers is essential to elevate the code to full compliance.
