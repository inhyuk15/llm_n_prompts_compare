1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates systematic error handling aligned with the guidelines by defining a unified error code enum, ensuring all functions return error states, and clearly propagating errors. It distinguishes between recoverable and fatal errors and incorporates fail-safe default settings such as zero time inputs and cycle limits. However, while error propagation is clear within the provided functions, some recovery mechanisms for recoverable errors could be enhanced, and explicit documentation of error categories could improve clarity.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계가 있다면 그것을 따르며 없다면 enum 사용하여 통일된 에러처리를 하도록 함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code clearly defines a unified error_t enum covering various error scenarios including fatal errors (ERR_FATAL=0xFF), fulfilling the requirement for a consistent error code system.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All non-void functions explicitly return error_t values; even void functions either do not require error returns or are not indicated as requiring it by the guidelines. Functions like setup_gpio, turn_off_all, set_gpio_level, pedestrian_blink, read_positive_float, and run_traffic_light all consistently return error codes.

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code propagates errors clearly up the call stack, e.g., run_traffic_light returns errors from subordinate functions without suppression, and app_main checks and handles returned error codes immediately with appropriate messages.

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Fail-safe defaults are set, such as limiting blinking cycles to MAX_BLINK_CYCLES, verifying input ranges, setting cycle counts not to exceed maximums, and zero-checking stop and walk times to avoid invalid operation.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code comments and structure distinguish recoverable errors (e.g., ignoring zero blink duration as non-error) versus fatal errors (e.g., mutex creation failures, GPIO initialization failures), marking potentially unrecoverable errors with comments like "치명적 에러" (fatal error).

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The implementation effectively handles error states with a consistent enum and propagates errors to the application entry point for logging and termination as needed. The use of comments to mark fatal versus recoverable errors demonstrates intentional categorization, supporting maintainability. A minor improvement area is explicit documentation or naming conventions in code to programmatically differentiate fatal versus recoverable errors, as this is currently communicated through comments only. Additionally, while fail-safe conditions exist, recovery actions (such as retry logic or fallback) are limited, so error handling is mostly fail-fast rather than recovery-oriented. Overall, the code complies comprehensively with the provided error handling guidelines, contributing to robust and maintainable software behavior.
