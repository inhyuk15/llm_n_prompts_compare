1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code generally adheres to complexity guidelines by splitting logic into multiple small functions, each performing specific tasks. No function exceeds 50 lines, and the function parameter counts are within the 5-parameter limit. Nested control flow structures remain reasonably shallow. However, cyclomatic complexity is not explicitly calculated and must be inferred, which leaves slight ambiguity on exact metric values.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The code organizes logic into multiple small functions, typically with simple control flows, suggesting low cyclomatic complexity; however, the exact cyclomatic complexity metric is not provided or measured, making full compliance unverifiable.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions exhibit a maximum nesting depth of 2–3 levels (e.g., run_traffic_light uses a for(;;) infinite loop with no deeper nesting); no nested control structure exceeds 4 levels.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function in the code is notably concise, none exceed 50 lines according to the provided source code.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions have 0 to 2 parameters; no function exceeds 5 parameters.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The modular design reduces complexity per function and aids readability and maintainability.  
- Cyclomatic complexity should be explicitly calculated or measured to remove ambiguity; ideally, include comments or tool output verifying values.  
- No excessive nesting or overly long functions detected, indicating good adherence to maintainability rules.  
- Parameter limits are strictly observed, demonstrating disciplined interface design.  

Overall, the code is structurally compliant with the complexity constraints but requires explicit cyclomatic complexity verification for completeness.
