1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code exhibits comprehensive and systematic documentation adhering to a standard commenting style consistent with the Google C/C++ style, as no project-specific style is provided in the guidelines. Function headers use the Doxygen-compatible format (@brief, @param, @retval), and constants as well as enums have meaningful inline comments describing their purpose. This satisfies the guideline requirement of adding systematic code documentation.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX  

Guideline_Item: 코드에 체계적인 문서화를 추가하세요  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code consistently uses structured comments following the google standard C/C++ style with Doxygen-style tags (@brief, @param, @retval) for all functions, includes inline comments for enums and #defines, and maintains uniform comment formatting throughout. No project-specific style exists, so the guideline's fallback style is applied correctly.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
There are no systemic issues noted in documentation. The use of detailed function descriptions, proper parameter and return value annotations, and descriptive inline comments mitigate ambiguity and support maintainability. The documentation covers error codes, function actions, parameters, and return values clearly, which supports code compliance with the stated guideline fully.
