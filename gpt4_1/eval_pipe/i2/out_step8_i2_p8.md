1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code applies consistent formatting and naming conventions throughout the source file. It uses uppercase with underscores for macros and constants, camel case with initial uppercase letters for function names, and lowercase with underscores for variable names, aligning with typical Google C++ style conventions. Code comments are uniformly styled, and indentation and spacing are consistent. However, since the project’s specific formatting or naming rules are not provided, evaluation is based on conformance to Google standard C/C++ style as per the guideline.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX  

Guideline_Item: 코드 작성시 일관된 formatting과 naming 규칙을 적용하세요 - 프로젝트에 이미 코드 formatting 및 naming 규칙이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 작성  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The guideline requires adherence to existing project rules if available, but the presence or contents of any project-specific formatting or naming rules is not provided; unable to determine compliance in this context.

Guideline_Item: 코드 작성시 일관된 formatting과 naming 규칙을 적용하세요 - 프로젝트에 naming 규칙이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일을 적용하여 formatting및 naming 규칙 적용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code follows Google C/C++ style conventions, including CamelCase for functions (e.g., SetupGpio, TurnOffAll), uppercase separated by underscores for constants/macros (e.g., RED_PIN, MAX_BLINK_CYCLES), consistent indentation, well-spaced operators, consistent brace placement, and descriptive comments consistent with Google style guidelines.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
- The absence of explicit project formatting and naming rules requires assumption of Google standard style application, which the code matches well.  
- The code consistently uses a clear and readable style with appropriate comment blocks, self-describing names, and uniform structure, minimizing maintenance risks related to inconsistent style.  
- No significant formatting or naming inconsistencies were detected that could lead to confusion or complicate future code review or modification efforts.
