1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code adheres well to a systematic error handling structure with a clear enum-based error code system (ErrorCode). All functions return an error state, facilitating consistent error propagation. Fail-safe defaults and basic recovery approaches are implemented, especially in critical initialization and state reset functions. However, the distinction between recoverable and fatal errors could be improved, and explicit comments or code constructs clarifying that separation are limited.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계가 있다면 그것을 따르며 없다면 enum 사용하여 통일된 에러처리를 하도록 함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code defines an explicit ErrorCode enum used uniformly across all functions to represent error states, e.g., ERR_OK, ERR_FAIL, ERR_INVALID_ARG, etc.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All major functions (lcd_init_custom, lcd_display_line, button_pressed, str_to_double, calculate, calculate_single, handle_operator_button, handle_equal_button, handle_number_button, handle_clear_button, gpio_buttons_init) return ErrorCode values indicating success or specific errors.

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Error codes returned by called functions are checked and propagated upwards. For example, handle_operator_button returns errors from calculate and lcd_display_line, and app_main halts system execution on critical init errors, signifying clear error propagation.

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Fail safe defaults are set by reset_calc which initializes calculator to zero values and known states. app_main halts operation if hardware init fails, preventing further unsafe operation.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The code implicitly recovers from non-critical errors, such as logging LCD errors, and resets calculator state on invalid cases. Critical failures (e.g., LCD or GPIO init failure) cause system halt. However, there is no explicit comment or code pattern clearly marking error severity or recoverability; the distinction is implicit and would benefit from explicit documentation or separate error handling policies.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The provided code demonstrates a strong structured approach to error handling by employing a unified ErrorCode enum and propagating errors through function returns. Initialization functions handle failures by logging and halting safely, ensuring critical resources are valid before operation. Non-critical errors are logged as warnings, with functions continuing where possible, which is appropriate for user interface elements like LCD updates.

One systemic area for enhancement is explicit documentation or code constructs to categorize errors as recoverable or fatal beyond implicit handling patterns. Clear labelling or separation would improve maintainability and clarify error response protocols. Overall, the code effectively implements the prescribed guidelines with minor room for explicit recoverability classification.

This assessment is based solely on the provided guidelines and code.
