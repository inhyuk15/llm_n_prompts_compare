1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code partially meets the guidelines for lowering code complexity. Most functions have a limited number of lines, and function parameters do not exceed five. However, the cyclomatic complexity and nesting depth were not explicitly measured and analyzed. Functions such as handle_operator_button include multiple switch cases that may raise cyclomatic complexity. There is no evidence of explicit function splitting to enforce cyclomatic complexity ≤10 or nesting depth ≤4. Therefore, a full compliance cannot be confirmed without detailed complexity metrics.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The code does not provide explicit cyclomatic complexity metrics; no information if any function exceeds 10. Manual review suggests handle_operator_button might exceed this. A formal complexity evaluation is required.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions inspected show maximum nesting depth clearly below 4 levels. For example, handle_operator_button uses switch-case (no nested if inside cases), and other functions do not nest beyond two or three levels.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions in the code are well within 50 lines limit; for instance, even handle_operator_button, one of the larger functions, is approximately 33 lines.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Function gpio_buttons_init takes no parameters (PASS), others like lcd_display_line take 2 params (PASS), but none seems to exceed 5 parameters. However, the function lcd_init_custom calls lcd_create with 6 parameters (LCD pins), violating this. Since lcd_create is called within lcd_init_custom, and lcd_init_custom takes no parameters itself, function parameters count relates to function signature, not arguments in a call. Given no function definition in the code exceeds 5 parameters, this is PASS.

Re-evaluating: No function signature has more than 5 parameters.

Therefore, update to: PASS

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- Cyclomatic complexity is a critical metric for code maintainability and testability but is missing explicit evidence here. Functions with multiple switch-case branches and conditional logic (e.g., handle_operator_button) could approach or exceed complexity limits. Automated complexity measurement should be performed to ensure compliance.

- The code avoids deep nesting, which aids readability.

- Function length limits are respected, enhancing maintainability.

- The function parameter constraint is met across all defined functions. Note that passing multiple GPIO pin constants as parameters to lcd_create is a single function call with multiple arguments, not function parameter count.

- For future revisions, instrumentation or static analysis tools are recommended to determine cyclomatic complexity and nesting depth quantitatively.

- Overall code organization is modular and clear, but explicit documentation or comments on complexity metrics would support compliance.
