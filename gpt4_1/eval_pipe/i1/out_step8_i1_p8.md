2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Apply consistent formatting and naming rules as per project or Google C/C++ standards  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Code uses clear, consistent indentation, spacing, and brace placement. Function names use camel case (e.g., LcdInit, HandleNumberButton), types and enums use PascalCase (e.g., ErrorCode, CalcState), macros use all caps with underscores, and variable naming is consistent and meaningful throughout.

Guideline_Item: Follow project formatting and naming rules if available; otherwise apply Google C/C++ standard naming and formatting  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No project-specific rules provided; code follows Google C/C++ style conventions consistently, fulfilling fallback requirement.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

No systemic formatting or naming inconsistencies were observed. The code demonstrates disciplined adherence to a consistent style. This reduces risks of maintenance difficulties or misinterpretations due to formatting or naming irregularities. No violations or ambiguities relating to formatting or naming conventions are present.
