1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code demonstrates a generally sound approach to memory safety by using static allocation for global variables and minimizing stack usage with detailed stack usage comments. Buffer overflow risks are mitigated by bound checks when appending digits and careful usage of string functions with explicit null termination. However, there are minor areas requiring improvement, such as the 'get_operator_from_button' function being stubbed with inadequate implementation, and a slightly inconsistent use of strncpy with an off-by-one precaution needing explicit explanation in comments.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code uses static allocation for the global Calculator struct ‘calc’, LCD handle ‘lcd’, and static variables within functions (e.g., ‘digit’ in app_main). No dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free) is present.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions contain detailed comments specifying stack usage, including sizes of local variables and notes on library/internal calls stack costs.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function has a clear comment above it describing anticipated stack usage and explaining when local storage is zero or minimal.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: While append_digit() correctly checks display length before appending, strncpy() in app_main for copying ‘buf’ to calc.display is used with sizeof(calc.display)-1 and then sets a null terminator. This is safe, but the comment stating it as “사실상 동일” to strcpy might mislead maintainers. Also, no boundary check or input validation for snprintf() formatting of floating-point results is performed. The buffer sizes, while adequate for the intended LCD 16x2, should be explicitly stated to avoid overflows from unexpected inputs in future changes. To fix, explicitly validate snprintf output length and clarify strncpy usage with exact buffer size comments.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Global variables are minimized and declared static with limited scope, i.e., ‘calc’ and ‘lcd’ handles are static, maintaining encapsulation and reducing global namespace pollution.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함 (이미 counted, no duplicates)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: (Duplicate guideline, already counted.)

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

System-wide, the code exemplifies a conscious effort to maintain memory safety and minimize stack consumption suitable for embedded systems with constrained resources. The use of static variables and pre-allocated buffers is consistent and appropriate. Input handling functions include boundary checks that prevent buffer overflow, a critical aspect for embedded C applications controlling hardware.

The primary risk arises from the minor ambiguity in string copy operations with strncpy, which could be further clarified with stronger comments or the use of safer string handling functions. Moreover, the stub function get_operator_from_button returning OP_NONE unconditionally might cause logic inconsistencies if expanded in the future without appropriate memory safety checks.

Overall, the code complies well with the given guidelines but should document string operation safety more explicitly to avoid potential future regressions.
