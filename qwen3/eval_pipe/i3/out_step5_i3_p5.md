1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code demonstrates partial compliance with the multitasking safety guidelines. It employs volatile variables and custom mutex-like flags for shared resource protection and uses explicit critical section protection by disabling interrupts. However, the mutex implementation uses busy-wait loops without yielding, and the atomicity of operations on mutex variables is uncertain, potentially risking race conditions. Functions lack explicit reentrancy guarantees, and no hardware atomic operations or OS-supported critical sections are used, limiting robust multitasking safety.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 공유 자원에 volatile 키워드 사용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: lcd_mutex and led_mutex variables are declared as volatile uint8_t, ensuring the compiler does not optimize accesses to these shared flags.

Guideline_Item: 환경에 Critical section 식별 및 보호 매커니즘이 있다면 사용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Critical sections are protected by disabling and enabling interrupts (using noInterrupts() and interrupts()) around accesses to shared mutex flags and shared peripherals, preventing interrupt-based concurrency.

Guideline_Item: 재진입 가능한 함수로 변경  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Functions like acquire_lcd and acquire_led use busy-wait loops that are not designed for reentrancy and may block indefinitely; also, no function-level reentrancy guarantees are present. The use of static variables and global mutexes without recursion support indicates non-reentrant design. To fix, rewrite functions to avoid busy waits by using OS primitives or to support safe recursive calls.

Guideline_Item: 원자적 연산 보장  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The atomicity of reading and writing the volatile uint8_t mutex flags is not guaranteed on all platforms, and the busy-wait loops lack memory barriers or atomic test-and-set operations. This may cause race conditions. To fix, replace manual flag variables with hardware atomic operations or OS mutex primitives.

Guideline_Item: Race condition 발생 여지가 없도록 방지  
Status: REVIEW REQUIRED  
Reason: While interrupts are disabled during flag accesses to prevent some concurrency issues, the lack of guaranteed atomic operations and busy-wait loops could lead to race conditions especially in multicore/interrupt scenarios. Additional information about the platform's atomic operation guarantees and multicore configuration is needed to fully assess race condition prevention.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code attempts to enforce mutual exclusion using volatile flags with busy waits and disabling interrupts as critical sections. This manual approach is prone to deadlocks and race conditions on multicore or preemptive multitasking systems. There is no use of standardized atomic operations or OS mutexes, which is a notable deficiency for mission-critical multitasking environments. Functions are not designed for reentrancy, which may cause issues if called from multiple contexts or interrupts. Overall, the code’s concurrency control is rudimentary and would benefit from migration to atomic hardware primitives and OS-provided synchronization mechanisms for robust multitasking safety.
