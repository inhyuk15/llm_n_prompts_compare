1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates a structured error handling approach, utilizing an enum error code system consistently across all functions. All functions return an error state, and error propagation is clear through returned codes. The code distinguishes between recoverable errors (e.g., formatting or parsing errors) and potentially fatal errors (e.g., mutex acquisition failure). Fail-safe behavior is partially implemented by clearing the LCD and avoiding undefined states, though some functions could enhance default safe-state settings.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계가 있다면 그것을 따르며 없다면 enum 사용하여 통일된 에러처리를 하도록 함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code defines an `ErrorCode` enum representing error states and uses it consistently for error returns in all functions.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions explicitly return an `ErrorCode` indicating success or failure, including display functions and hardware access functions.

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Errors are checked at each step in `loop()` and other calling functions, with clear conditional handling and error display functions, demonstrating well-defined error propagation.

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: While some fail-safe actions exist, such as clearing the LCD upon errors and returning errors when mutex acquisition fails, the code does not explicitly set all related hardware or state variables to safe defaults upon error (e.g., the LED state might remain HIGH if error occurs during dispensing). To fix, explicitly reset hardware outputs (LED off) and ensure all shared states revert to safe defaults after error conditions.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code differentiates recoverable errors (such as `ERROR_PARSING`, `ERROR_INVALID_PRODUCT`) with user feedback, versus critical errors like `ERROR_MUTEX_ACQUIRE` that trigger different handling (e.g., clearing LCD without further action).

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The system employs a clear and unified error code definition with consistent error returns and propagation checks, fulfilling most of the guideline expectations. However, fail-safe handling can be improved: the LED control does not guarantee a safe off state if an error interrupts the dispensing sequence, which could lead to hardware remaining unexpectedly active. The mutex acquisition pattern is well implemented but should include additional cleanup to prevent deadlocks or inconsistent states. Overall, error handling is robust but could benefit from a comprehensive fail-safe state reset strategy to mitigate unexpected hardware or system states after errors.
