1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The submitted code meets the complexity guidelines effectively. Each function contains fewer than 50 lines, uses at most five parameters, and contains limited control flow complexity. The maximum observed cyclomatic complexity does not exceed 10, and nesting of conditional blocks is within the allowable four-level maximum.

Compliance Rate: 100.00 %

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX  

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function (e.g., dispenseProduct, parseInput) has simple control flow, with at most a couple of conditional branches, never exceeding cyclomatic complexity of 10.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The deepest nesting observed is 2 levels (e.g., dispenseProduct has if-else with no further nested conditions), well within the limit of 4 levels.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function is concise; for instance, dispenseProduct is about 20 lines, and no function exceeds 50 lines.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions have 0 to 2 parameters, complying with the maximum of 5 parameters per function.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
The code demonstrates good modularization, effective input validation, and clear functional separation, minimizing complexity. No systemic issues related to complexity or maintainability are present. The usage of constants and descriptive naming improves readability and helps maintain low complexity. There is no indication of excessive branching or deep nesting that could impair maintainability or testing.
