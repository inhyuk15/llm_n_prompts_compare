1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates substantial compliance with the memory safety guidelines. Static allocation is properly used for global variables, reducing dynamic allocation risks; stack usage is explicitly commented for functions setup and loop, meeting documentation requirements; buffer boundary checks are implemented for the input buffer to prevent overflows. However, the global variables are declared static and minimal, complying with the global scope limitation guideline. Overall, four of the five guideline elements fully pass, with one minor issue requiring review.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All variables outside functions are declared static and globally, e.g., lcd, LED_PIN, I2C_SDA, I2C_SCL, and productPrices. No dynamic memory allocation is present.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code comments explicitly state the stack usage for setup (0 bytes) and loop (52 bytes) functions, reflecting accurate stack size accounting.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Both setup() and loop() functions contain stack usage comments indicating their respective stack sizes.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The input buffer 'inputBuffer' is statically allocated with size 32; Serial.readBytesUntil is called with (sizeof(inputBuffer) - 1) to prevent overflow; null-termination is explicitly done; no write operations exceed boundaries.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Although global variables are declared static, it is unclear if the quantity and necessity of these global variables have been minimized sufficiently per the intent of this guideline. The guidelines do not specify thresholds or alternatives to further reduce globals.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code applies strong memory safety practices through static allocation and explicit stack usage commentary. The input handling robustly prevents buffer overflow by considering boundary sizes and null termination. The use of static variables limits global scope leakage. The only review-required aspect involves the degree of global variable minimization; the code uses a moderate number of globals, all static, but no justification or alternatives are given. There is no evidence of dynamic allocations or unsafe memory operations. Overall, the implementation addresses the guidelines effectively with clear stack overhead awareness and boundary safety.
