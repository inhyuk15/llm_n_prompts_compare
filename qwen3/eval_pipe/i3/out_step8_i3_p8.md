1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code applies consistent formatting and naming conventions throughout, demonstrating adherence to a clear style. Since the project naming conventions are not explicitly provided, the code follows Google C/C++ style conventions for naming and formatting, consistent with the guideline. Minor inconsistencies such as the occasional use of plural naming for arrays and singular for constants do not violate the guideline as Google style permits such distinctions.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 이미 코드 formatting 및 naming 규칙이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 작성  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: No explicit project formatting or naming guidelines are provided in the input. Cannot confirm if existing project rules were followed.

Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 naming 규칙이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일을 적용하여 formatting및 naming 규칙 적용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Code naming conventions and formatting align well with Google C/C++ style standards—e.g., enums in uppercase with underscore separation, camelCase for function names (trim_input, parse_input), constants in uppercase with underscores, consistent indentation, and proper brace positioning.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
- The code consistently uses all uppercase with underscores for constants and enum error codes, matching Google style's macro and constant naming rules.  
- Function names use lowercase with underscores separating words, which aligns with Google style recommendations for function naming in C/C++.  
- Indentation and spacing are consistent throughout, with clear separation between functions and logical blocks.  
- Commenting style and usage of Doxygen-style comments further reflect structured coding standards, supporting maintainability.  
- The only ambiguity lies in the absence of explicit project-level formatting and naming guidelines; therefore, the first guideline could not be fully verified and was marked as REVIEW.  
- No evidence of conflicting or inconsistent naming or formatting was found.  
- Mutex variables are declared as volatile and use underscore naming consistent with constants.  
- Overall, the code demonstrates good adherence to accepted C/C++ style appropriate for mission-critical software compliance.

Summary: The code complies well with the guideline of using Google standard C/C++ style formatting and naming conventions in absence of project-specific rules, but because no project-specific formatting rules are supplied, full verification of the first guideline is not possible.
