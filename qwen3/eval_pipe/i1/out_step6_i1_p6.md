1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates systematic error handling using a defined enum `ErrorCode`, satisfying the requirement for a unified error code system. All functions return an error status, and errors are propagated clearly with return values checked and communicated to the user interface. The code sets default or safe states on errors, such as clearing buffers, supporting fail-safe behavior. However, the code does not explicitly distinguish between recoverable and fatal errors, which is required by the guidelines. Overall, the implementation strongly aligns with the guidelines except for the lack of error severity classification.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계가 있다면 그것을 따르며 없다면 enum 사용하여 통일된 에러처리를 하도록 함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Defined an `ErrorCode` enum covering all error types; all functions return `ErrorCode` values consistently, ensuring unified error representation.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All relevant functions return an `ErrorCode` indicating success or specific failure (e.g., `truncateToLCD`, `appendChar`, `handleClear`, `displayResult`, etc.).

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions check error returns of called functions and propagate errors up to the caller, which then displays error messages on the LCD.

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions like `handleClear()` reset buffers and states to safe defaults; errors lead to error messages and clearing the display to avoid undefined states.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code uses a single enum for all errors but does not categorize or differentiate recoverable vs. fatal errors anywhere in the logic or error handling process. Adding explicit classification and handling logic for error severity is required.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The error handling approach is systematic and comprehensive in propagating errors via return codes and displaying error information to users. The use of an enum to standardize error codes enhances maintainability and clarity. Setting safe defaults upon clear operations prevents cascading faults. The main deficiency is the absence of error severity classification (recoverable vs. fatal), which can be critical for system resilience and recovery strategy definition. Incorporating severity levels, such as extending the enum or adding separate handling paths, would improve robustness and compliance with best practices noted in the guidelines.
