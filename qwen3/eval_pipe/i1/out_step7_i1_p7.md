2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 코드에 체계적인 문서화를 추가하세요  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The entire code is annotated using Google standard C/C++ style documentation with consistent use of Doxygen-compatible tags, appropriate parameter and return descriptions, and explanatory comments for all variables and functions.

Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 이미 코드 문서화 스타일이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 주석 작성 / 프로젝트에 문서화 스타일이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일 적용하여 주석 작성  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No existing project style was specified, so adherence to the Google standard C/C++ style is confirmed by the consistent use of @brief, parameter tags, properly formatted multi-line comments, and other conforming elements visible throughout the code.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

There are no deviations or inconsistencies in the documentation style. The comments provide useful context and clear explanations of function roles, parameters, return types, and global variables. The usage of noInterrupts()/interrupts() is clearly contextualized within functions. Variables and enums have descriptive comments, enhancing code readability and maintainability. No gaps or missing documentation segments were found. The documentation approach adopted reduces risks of misunderstandings in future maintenance or audits.
