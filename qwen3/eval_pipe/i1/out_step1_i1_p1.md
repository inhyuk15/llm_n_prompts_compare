1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code demonstrates strong adherence to static memory allocation requirements by using fixed-size static buffers and avoids dynamic memory. It includes buffer boundary checks before writing to arrays, which mitigates buffer overflow risks. However, the code lacks explicit comments specifying stack usage per function, and although global variables are minimized and marked static, some minor improvements are possible in fully restricting scope. Overall, compliance is considerable but incomplete given missing stack usage comments.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All buffers (input, firstNum, secondNum) are declared as fixed-size static char arrays; no dynamic allocation exists.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The code does not include any calculation or explicit notes about stack usage for functions.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Only the displayInput() function has a comment "스택 사용량: ~17바이트 (displayBuff)", but this is incomplete and no other function has stack usage comments. The coverage is insufficient to comply with this requirement.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code performs buffer boundary checks before appending characters to input, firstNum, and secondNum arrays, using conditions like "if (len < BUFFER_SIZE - 1)".

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Global variables are minimized and declared static where possible (input, firstNum, secondNum, operation, isSecondNum), thus limiting scope correctly.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The code effectively avoids dynamic memory allocation, improving memory safety on embedded platforms.  
- Boundary checks before buffer writes are systematically implemented, greatly reducing risk of buffer overflow.  
- Global variables are well controlled and declared static, restricting their scope within the translation unit.  
- Lack of comprehensive stack usage comments represents a procedural compliance gap; explicit stack usage comments are necessary for all non-trivial functions to meet guidelines.  
- The single partial comment on displayInput()'s stack use is insufficient; the other functions like loop() and setup() also manipulate buffers and require similar documentation.  
- Introducing stack usage comments would improve maintainability and help identify potential memory constraints early in embedded environments.
