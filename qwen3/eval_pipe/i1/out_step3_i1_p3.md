1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code mostly complies with complexity reduction guidelines; all functions are relatively short and have limited parameters. However, precise cyclomatic complexity and nesting depth metrics are not explicitly calculated but can be inferred as within limits given clear, simple conditionals and no deep nested structures. Overall, the code is modular and well structured. A minor issue exists in the function displayResult regarding a potentially incorrect format specifier which does not affect complexity rules but should be reviewed.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function exhibits simple control flow—no function has complex branching or multiple nested conditionals. Functions like loop have only one if with else if chains, and switch statements are simple. This design maintains cyclomatic complexity below 10 per function.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Nested control structures do not exceed four levels. The loop() function contains only a single-level if-else cascade. Other functions exhibit straightforward control flow without deep nesting.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions are clearly under 50 lines. The longest function, displayResult, is approximately 20 lines. This adheres to the maximum line count per function.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions have at most 3 parameters (e.g., truncateToLCD has three; calculateResult has three parameters). No function violates the 5 parameter limit.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The code is well modularized with focused functions, aiding readability and maintenance.  
- No apparent deep nesting or complex conditional logic threatens maintainability or testability.  
- Though cyclomatic complexity is not explicitly measured via tooling, given the evident simple control flow, the code safely meets the requirement.  
- A minor issue unrelated to complexity: In displayResult(), the snprintf call uses "%s %c %s = %.%ug" as format. The 'u' specifier following precision is invalid for floating point numbers—this could cause unexpected formatting at runtime. This should be corrected to something like "%.10g" to specify precision properly. However, this does not impact complexity or compliance with the provided guidelines.  
- Overall, the code adheres well to the guidelines ensuring manageable complexity, nesting, function length, and parameter count.
