2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX  

Guideline_Item: 코드 작성시 일관된 formatting과 naming 규칙을 적용하세요 - 프로젝트에 이미 코드 formatting 및 naming 규칙이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 작성, 프로젝트에 naming 규칙이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일을 적용하여 formatting및 naming 규칙 적용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code uses consistent indentation, spacing, and commenting style that corresponds with Google C/C++ style guidelines. Naming conventions differentiate constants (uppercase with underscores), types (PascalCase enum), and variables/functions (lowercase with underscores or camelCase). No evident deviations or inconsistent formatting are present.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
No systemic formatting or naming issues were found. Variable, function, and type names are consistent and meaningful. Constants use uppercase with underscores, functions use lowerCamelCase consistent with Google style for C code, and macros/constants have explicit “U” suffix for unsigned values. The code is clean and well-commented. No ambiguous or conflicting styles that would require review or rework were detected.
