1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code exhibits partial compliance with the MISRA-C 2012 mandatory rules. It properly avoids magic numbers for zeros and ones and adds a default case in the switch statement; however, issues such as multiple return points in functions, potential implicit type conversions, missing breaks in some switch cases, and logical expressions with side effects violate the guidelines. The lack of explicit integer type usage in some variables and repeated return points weakens overall compliance.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.1: 적절한 operator 활용  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The guidelines require appropriate use of operators, but no explicit criteria or examples define what constitutes appropriate operators. The code does not present obviously inappropriate operators, but without explicit criteria, full assessment is unclear.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.3: 암묵적 타입 변환 제거  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Implicit conversions occur, for example, when assigning a double result to formatted output with %g and using snprintf with diverse argument types. Also, using double variables (num1, num2, result) without explicit floating-point typing adherence may cause implicit conversions. No explicit casts enforce type conformity.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.4: 필수 타입 모델 준수  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code uses general C types like 'double' and 'bool' without confirmation that they meet MISRA-C required type models; for example, floating-point usage is not explicitly checked or controlled. Also, usage of 'bool' without stdbool.h or explicit typedef could cause type model issues.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.1: 모든 switch문에 default 케이스 추가  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The switch on 'operation' includes a default: case that assigns 0.0 to result, satisfying this rule.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.4: 모든 경로에 break  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: While the main switch cases have break statements, flow control regarding the else-if ladder in the loop function does not clearly terminate all control paths with break statements, and an implicit fall-through was not observed but not explicitly documented. The memset and displayInput calls outside of switches complicate flow analysis.

Guideline_Item: Rule 15.5: 함수는 단일 exit point (return문 하나)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code uses multiple early returns implicitly by structure of loop and setup functions and by using return-less looping. Although setup and loop are void functions, this guideline typically applies more to non-void; the code has no explicit return but the overall structure with no multiple exits is ambiguous and should be verified.

Guideline_Item: Rule 13.5: 논리 연산자 &&, || 의 우항에 부작용 금지  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The expression `(operation != ' ') && (strlen(firstNum) > 0U) && (strlen(secondNum) > 0U)` involves function calls in the right-hand operands, which could be considered side effects. strlen is a function call and potentially expensive; while not producing side effects, MISRA treats function calls in logical expressions as side effects depending on the context. This is borderline but generally considered a violation.

Guideline_Item: Rule 8.7: Magic number를 명명된 상수로 변경 (0, 1 제외)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All magic numbers except 0 and 1 are defined as named constants, e.g., INPUT_BUFFER_SIZE, LCD_WIDTH, CLEAR_DELAY_MS, RESULT_PRECISION.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  

The code generally uses named constants well, supporting readability and maintainability. However, the use of implicit type conversions with floating-point variables and mixed types in snprintf calls demonstrates a lack of strict type discipline expected by MISRA-C 2012. The lack of explicit typedefs or adherence to fixed-width types for floating-point and boolean types poses potential model violations. The code partially addresses switch statement completeness but does not fully guarantee breaks on all code paths and contains a logical condition which might be considered to include side effects in logical expressions. Multiple functions use multiple logical conditions with embedded function calls, which MISRA discourages. The single exit point rule is vague here due to the structure and return types of functions but still appears violated due to implicit returns in loop and other constructs. The ambiguity in operator use and absence of explicit examples limit the ability to fully assess Rule 10.1 compliance. Overall, careful restructuring and explicit typing adjustments are necessary to improve compliance.
