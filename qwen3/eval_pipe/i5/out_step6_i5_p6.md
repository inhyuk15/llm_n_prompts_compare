1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code implements a structured error handling approach using an enum for error codes, ensuring all functions return error statuses. Error propagation is managed with a global systemError variable for critical errors and error returns for recoverable ones. Basic fail-safe initialization and separation of recoverable versus fatal errors are present, though some inconsistencies and unclear recoverability in certain error flows warrant attention.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계가 있다면 그것을 따르며 없다면 enum 사용하여 통일된 에러처리를 하도록 함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code defines an enum ErrorCode with explicit error codes and uses it consistently across functions.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All key functions such as trimString, processCommand, handleCarIn, and handleCarOut return an ErrorCode value indicating success or failure.

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions return error codes propagated to callers; systemError holds critical errors. In the main loop, errors from subfunctions are checked and handled accordingly, demonstrating explicit error propagation.

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Initialization sets systemError to ERROR_NONE by default. In setup(), a failed LCD I2C communication sets systemError to an explicit error code, allowing fail-safe behavior and error display on LCD.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Although the code distinguishes unrecoverable errors (like LCD init failure using systemError) from recoverable command errors (returned and can continue operation), the exact classification is implicit rather than formally documented or enforced in code. The criteria or mechanism for recovery is not explicitly defined, requiring clarification.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code demonstrates strong adherence to systematic error handling by defining and utilizing a unified error code enum and by making all relevant functions return errors consistently. Error propagation is clearly implemented with a global critical error indicator and error code returns for operation-level issues. Fail-safe default states and error indications on the LCD are implemented, improving robustness.

However, the recoverability classification of errors is partially ambiguous. While some errors set a global critical flag and others return codes to the main loop, the boundary and handling strategy between recoverable and fatal errors is not explicitly codified, which could lead to inconsistent interpretation or handling in future extensions. A formal definition or comment on which errors are deemed fatal vs. recoverable and how they impact system state would enhance clarity and compliance.

No outright functional deficiencies were found in the error handling mechanisms, but addressing the indicated clarification would improve completeness and auditability.
