1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code largely complies with the memory safety guidelines by utilizing static allocation for major variables, explicit buffer size management, and boundary checks when reading serial input. Stack usage is annotated for functions where stack allocations occur, and global variables are minimized with static scope limiting. However, the stack usage comments are incomplete and inconsistent, and there is a minor ambiguity regarding whether all static buffers meet the static allocation requirement fully. Overall, the code demonstrates strong adherence to memory safety but requires improvements on stack usage annotation completeness and exact static buffer allocations.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All major storage - arrays entryTimes, commandBuffer, totalFee, and static variables including buffers inside loop are statically allocated with size defined and no dynamic allocation present.  

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Stack usage comments exist only for loop() and setup()/updateLCD() but lack detailed breakdown for all functions, particularly for internal static buffers in loop(). Further, stack usage in updateLCD() and other functions is marked as 0 without accounting for any local variables, which may be an underestimate.  

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Some functions (setup, updateLCD, loop) contain stack usage comments, but these comments are inconsistent and incomplete. For example, in loop(), a 32-byte buffer is noted, but other local variables (e.g., int len, int bytesRead) are not fully accounted for or explicitly mentioned. Functions such as setup and updateLCD have "0 bytes" without full justification or counting of local variables, leading to insufficient documentation.  

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Serial input reading uses Serial.readBytesUntil with size limit (sizeof(commandBuffer) - 1), avoiding overflow. The code trims trailing whitespace carefully and uses snprintf with buffer size for safe formatted output, preventing buffer overflow.  

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Global variables currentCars, entryTimes, and totalFee are declared static to restrict scope. No unnecessary global variables are present. LCD object and constants are outside but justified for hardware initialization and compile-time constants.  

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code demonstrates good practices by avoiding dynamic allocations entirely and using clearly sized static buffers, which reduces heap-related risks. Use of snprintf and careful buffer sizing for serial input ensure buffer overflows are prevented. The use of static variables for state management confirms adherence to scope restriction guidelines.

However, the audit reveals incomplete and inconsistent stack usage annotations. Precise stack usage calculations are critical for mission-critical systems to ensure predictable memory use, especially in embedded environments. Comments should explicitly detail all local variables and buffers for every function, maintaining consistent unit measurements and rationale for the estimates.

Also, while static buffers inside the loop function exist, confirming them as truly static (allocated once for lifetime) vs stack-allocated on each invocation would ensure compliance with "All allocation must be static." The current code declares local buffers inside loop(), which are allocated on the stack each time, conflicting with the all-static allocation requirement. This requires revision—these buffers should be declared static inside the function to comply.

In summary, memory safety and variable scope practices are sound, but stack usage reporting and local stack buffer allocation need correction for full compliance.
