1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code generally maintains manageable complexity in individual functions, avoiding excessive parameter counts and very deep nesting. Most functions have clear, singular responsibilities and have fewer than or about 50 lines per function. However, the code does not explicitly document cyclomatic complexity metrics, and some functions show multiple conditional branches that may borderline the cyclomatic complexity threshold. No function exceeds a nesting depth of four or uses more than five parameters.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code does not measure or document cyclomatic complexity. Functions such as `loop()` and `handleCarOut()` contain multiple conditional branches and loops, potentially exceeding a cyclomatic complexity of 10. Without explicit measurement or refactoring to simplify complex logic paths, compliance cannot be guaranteed.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Inspection of all functions shows no nested structures exceeding four deep levels. The deepest nesting occurs in `handleCarOut()` with an if-condition and for-loop, which is within the specified limit.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions are under 50 lines. For example, `loop()` and `handleCarOut()` are approximately 20 lines or fewer, meeting the length requirement.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions have either zero or one parameter. No function exceeds five parameters.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The primary compliance issue is the lack of explicit cyclomatic complexity measurement or proof that it does not exceed 10 per function. Although the code demonstrates sound modular design, cyclomatic complexity should be quantified using a suitable tool or manually assessed with counts of decision points, and potentially refactored for functions nearing or exceeding the threshold. Other aspects, such as limiting nesting depth, function length, and parameter count, comply with guidelines and indicate good modularity and maintainability practices.
