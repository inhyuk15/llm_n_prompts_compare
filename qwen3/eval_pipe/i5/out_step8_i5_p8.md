1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code generally applies consistent formatting and naming conventions aligned with the Google C/C++ style guideline, as there is no indication of a pre-existing project-specific style. Identifiers use underscore_separators, and formatting is clear and consistent throughout the code. However, there are minor inconsistencies such as some comments using `///<` trailing style while others use block comments without a consistent style in all places, and minor spacing details could be slightly improved. Overall, the code meets the majority of the formatting and naming guideline requirements.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 이미 코드 formatting 및 naming 규칙이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 작성  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: It is unclear whether there is a pre-existing project-specific formatting and naming convention. The guideline requires adherence to existing project rules if present, but the code or guidelines do not specify if such project rules exist.

Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 naming 규칙이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일을 적용하여 formatting 및 naming 규칙 적용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code follows Google C/C++ style conventions in naming and formatting, including usage of lower_snake_case for variables and functions, uppercase with underscores for constants and macros, consistent indentation, spacing, and use of descriptive identifiers. For example, `currentCars`, `handleCarIn`, `ERROR_LCD_INIT_FAILED`, and `LCD_REFRESH_DELAY_MS` reflect conventional styles consistent with Google style recommendations.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The code uses consistent naming conventions: constants and macros use uppercase with underscores, enums are all uppercase, while function and variable names use camelCase or snake_case with clear and descriptive identifiers. This reflects adherence to typical Google Style stipulations.

- Formatting consistency is largely good with proper indentation, spacing around operators, braces in K&R style, and organized comments.

- Some comment styles vary (e.g., trailing `///<` for enum items and Doxygen-style block comments for functions). While not a major formatting violation, uniform comment style might be recommended.

- The code assumes no pre-existing style guide, but the audit cannot confirm this because the guideline does not specify project-specific formatting rules. This leads to a review requirement for clarification.

- Overall, no critical formatting or naming violations are detected. The code is clean and readable per the applied standards.

- Recommendation: Clarify whether a project-specific style guide exists to fully complete compliance assessment.

Final Compliance is valid with all guidelines accounted for.
