1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code demonstrates strong adherence to static allocation requirements, with all variables statically allocated and no dynamic memory usage observed. Stack usage is calculated and clearly documented in each function via comments. Use of static for global variables and scope limitation is consistent. However, the code lacks explicit boundary checks or safeguards to prevent buffer overflows when writing to the LCD display, which may cause potential memory safety issues. Thus, while the stack and allocation requirements are met, the absence of boundary checking for buffer safety leads to partial non-compliance.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX  

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All variables, including arrays and objects (lcd, elevator floors, button pins), are statically declared with no dynamic memory allocation usage.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function includes comments explicitly stating stack usage in bytes (e.g., setup: 4 bytes, move_elevator: 8 bytes, loop: 16 bytes).

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Stack usage is clearly documented immediately before or within each function implementation as comments.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code writes multiple fixed strings and elevator floor integers to the LCD without verifying cursor positions or buffer sizes; no boundary checks are implemented on LCD output calls, risking buffer overflow or display corruption. To fix, implement checks ensuring no LCD write exceeds display dimensions or buffer sizes and sanitize/limit printed content lengths.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Global variables (lcd, elevator floors, button pins) are declared static, limiting their scope properly and minimizing global namespace pollution.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  

The code follows robust memory allocation discipline, exclusively employing static memory and documenting stack usage, which aids in predictable memory management for mission-critical environments. Scope restriction with static globals further enhances safety. However, the key gap is the lack of defensive programming regarding output to the LCD device. While Arduino LCD libraries typically handle internal buffers, explicit boundary or length checks on prints are necessary to avoid buffer overflow scenarios, especially in constrained or customized environments. Future revisions should incorporate defensive measures—such as verifying string lengths before printing or employing safe print wrappers—to enforce this critical safety aspect. Addressing this deficiency will strengthen the overall memory safety compliance of the system.
