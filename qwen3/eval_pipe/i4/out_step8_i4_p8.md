1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code applies consistent formatting and naming conventions throughout the implementation. Given that no project-specific formatting or naming guidelines were provided, the code’s adherence to Google standard C/C++ style conventions (e.g., naming, spacing, braces, and comment style) is verified and found mostly consistent. There are no evident deviations from the Google style, including usage of PascalCase enum identifiers and camelCase function names. However, slight ambiguity exists because the code uses some macros in uppercase with underscores (which is standard), but a complete naming rule set for all identifiers is not explicitly evident and should be confirmed against any existing project rules if they become available.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 이미 코드 formatting 및 naming 규칙이 있다면 거기에 맞춰 작성  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No project-specific formatting or naming guidelines were provided; the code is uniformly formatted and consistent, so it is assumed compliant with any existing project conventions or appropriately neutral.

Guideline_Item: 프로젝트에 naming 규칙이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일을 적용하여 formatting및 naming 규칙 적용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: In absence of project naming conventions, the code employs Google standard C/C++ style: function names in camelCase, constants and macros in uppercase with underscores, enum members in uppercase with underscores, consistent brace placement, spacing, and comment style matching Google style recommendations.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code exhibits a consistent style in all declarations and definitions across multiple files and functions. Function names uniformly use camelCase format, matching Google C++ style guide recommendations. Constants are defined using uppercase snake_case macros, which aligns with common C/C++ standards and Google style for constants. Comments use Doxygen style with brief descriptions preceding functions and variables, enhancing readability and maintainability.

No inconsistent spacing, indentation, or brace positioning is observed. Enum constants follow a consistent uppercase naming style with underscores, which is recommended in Google C++ style for constants.

No mixed naming conventions or formatting styles that breach typical Google standards are identified. The code’s style is clean and systematic, reducing the risk of style-related misunderstandings in future maintenance.

No markings of forced style deviations or code snippets that would require exemption or justification are present.

Hence, the code fully complies with the provided guidelines on formatting and naming.
