1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code includes comprehensive and systematic documentation using Doxygen-style comments consistent with Google C/C++ style, providing clear explanations for functions, parameters, return values, and constants. There is no evidence of a pre-existing project documentation style stated; however, the use of a recognized standard style (Doxygen/Google style) effectively meets the requirement when no other style is provided.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 코드에 체계적인 문서화를 추가하세요 (주석 스타일: 기존 스타일이 없다면 google standard c/c++ 스타일 적용)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code uses comprehensive Doxygen-style comments throughout, consistent with Google C/C++ style documentation conventions, e.g., @brief, parameter and return descriptions, and inline constant explanations. No project-specific style was mentioned; thus, the applied style meets the guideline.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
- The documentation covers all major components: enumerations, constants, functions (with parameters and return values), and critical variables.  
- The documentation uses a consistent and clear style, improving maintainability and understandability of the code.  
- No guideline elements are missing or ambiguous; the use of standardized comments confirms compliance with the documentation requirement.
