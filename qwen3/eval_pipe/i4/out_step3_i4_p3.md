1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code generally adheres to the complexity guidelines with well-structured and separated functions. Each function appears focused, with no obvious violations related to excessive line count or parameter count, and no deeply nested structures are observed. However, explicit measurement of cyclomatic complexity is not provided and should be verified with a tool to confirm it does not exceed 10 per function.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Cyclomatic complexity values for the functions are not explicitly measured or documented; manual inspection suggests complexity is likely within limits, but an automated or calculated confirmation is needed to comply fully.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No function exceeds 4 levels of nested conditional or loop structures; all functions have low nesting depth evident by scan (mostly one or two levels max).

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions are succinct; none exceed 50 lines of code, with typical functions around 5–15 lines.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions have 2 or fewer parameters, complying with the 5-parameter maximum.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code features good modularization and usage of clear, small functions which reduce complexity risks. The low nesting level and limited function lengths reflect sound design for maintainability and readability. The sole area needing clarification is the explicit verification of cyclomatic complexity per function, which should be quantitatively measured (e.g., via a static analysis tool) to confirm adherence to the 10-level limit. Without such measurement, compliance cannot be fully confirmed.
