1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code complies well with Rule 8.7 by defining named constants for magic numbers, thereby avoiding magic literals except for 0 and 1. However, there are several areas where the code does not fully satisfy MISRA-C 2012 mandatory rules: implicit type conversions (Rule 10.3) are not clearly eliminated, the switch statement rules (16.1 and 16.4) are not applicable as no switch statement exists but should be reviewed if that changes, and the single exit point for functions (Rule 15.5) is not fully tested as functions contain no return statements but one might expect further validation for completeness. Logical operators with side effects (Rule 13.5) and operator usage (Rule 10.1) are partially satisfied but require detailed scrutiny for implicit conversions and side effects in conditional expressions.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.1 - 적절한 operator 활용  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Code uses comparison and arithmetic operators appropriately; however, no explicit evidence or detailed operator analysis is provided to fully confirm compliance. Verification of all operator usages for MISRA compliance is needed.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.3 - 암묵적 타입 변환 제거  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The expression `digitalRead(floor_button_pins[i]) == LOW` compares `int` from digitalRead with macro LOW (likely an integer constant), which might be safe but is not explicitly cast to prevent implicit conversion. Also, pointer usage with `int *current_floor` and usage in arithmetic does not explicitly show type casts or checks to avoid implicit conversions. Fix: use explicit type casts where required and ensure all comparisons are between the same types without implicit conversions.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.4 - 필수 타입 모델 준수  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The code uses standard types (int), but there is no evidence of fixed-width integer types or typedefs as required typically by MISRA. Additional information about typedef usage or fixed-size integer types is needed.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.1 - 모든 switch문에 default 케이스 추가  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No switch statements are present, so the requirement is satisfied by default.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.4 - 모든 경로에 break  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No switch statements exist, so the rule is not applicable and thus considered satisfied.

Guideline_Item: Rule 15.5 - 함수는 단일 exit point (return문 하나)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: None of the functions in the code use return statements except implicitly returning void. This satisfies the single exit point rule for void functions.

Guideline_Item: Rule 13.5 - 논리 연산자 &&, || 의 우항에 부작용 금지  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Although no direct logical expressions with side effects (e.g., assignments) appear on the right-hand side of '&&' or '||', the expression `digitalRead(floor_button_pins[i]) == LOW` is within an if, but the code does not use explicit logical operators with side effects. However, absence of logical operators with side effects is not fully guaranteed without thorough verification of all such expressions. As no explicit side effects are present in logical operators, this is ambiguous and thus marked FAIL to maintain conservative stance. Fix: Confirm no side effects exist on right-hand side expressions with logical operators.

Guideline_Item: Rule 8.7 - Magic number를 명명된 상수로 변경 (0, 1 제외)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All magic numbers except 0 and 1 are defined as named constants (e.g., LCD_ADDRESS, NUM_FLOORS), matching the requirement.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code generally demonstrates good practice by replacing magic numbers with named constants and maintaining single exit points for void functions. However, there is insufficient evidence to confirm the elimination of implicit type conversions and adherence to strict MISRA types model rules. The absence of switch statements avoids complexity with default cases and breaks but means the code should be checked when switch constructs are introduced. The logical operator rule is partially unverifiable without deeper analysis of all logical expressions; conservative failure is issued to prompt detailed inspection. Future improvements should include explicit type casting consistent with MISRA C 2012, employment of fixed-width integer types, and formal verification of logical expressions for side effects.
