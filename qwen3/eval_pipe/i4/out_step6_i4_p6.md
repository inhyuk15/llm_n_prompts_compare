1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code generally implements a consistent error handling mechanism using a defined enum type `ErrorCode`, satisfying the requirement for unified error codes. All key functions return an error status, showing adherence to explicit error status propagations. The error propagation paths are mostly clear, and basic safety measures such as input validation and clamping are in place. However, distinction and handling between recoverable and fatal errors are not fully realized in practice, and no explicit default fail-safe states are established beyond simple validations. Error handling in several places is minimal or only commented without concrete recovery logic, reducing robustness.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX  

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계가 있다면 그것을 따르며 없다면 enum 사용하여 통일된 에러처리를 하도록 함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code declares a comprehensive `enum ErrorCode` defining various error states including none, invalid parameter, null pointer, out of range, hardware failure, fatal, and recoverable errors. All functions return `ErrorCode`, ensuring unified error handling.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions visible in the code return an `ErrorCode` indicating success or specific error conditions, thus conforming to the requirement that all functions must return error statuses.

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions such as `process_button` and `handle_floor_buttons` propagate error codes from internal calls; error codes are checked and returned appropriately to calling functions, establishing clear error propagation channels.

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: While input validations with error returns are present, no default fail-safe states are set for global variables or system recovery mechanisms upon errors. For example, failed LCD updates are only noted in comments without resetting or safe fallback behavior, limiting fail-safe robustness. To fix, implement explicit default safe states or recovery actions when critical operations fail.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Although the enum includes `ERROR_RECOVERABLE` and `ERROR_FATAL`, the code does not differentiate or implement distinct handling paths for these error types. Error handling is mostly uniform without conditional logic for recoverable vs. fatal errors. For compliance, the code should detect error severity and execute separate handling strategies to recover or safely halt.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
The code shows a solid foundation for error handling through use of an enumerated error code and consistent function return types. Input validations and error code returns are well implemented, creating a clear error detection and propagation system. However, the absence of explicit differentiation between fatal and recoverable errors beyond the enum values introduces risk of inappropriate error management, possibly leading to unsafe states. Moreover, lack of concrete fail-safe mechanisms to restore system stability following failures impacts overall robustness. Comments suggest awareness of error handling needs (e.g., “Handle recoverable error”), but concrete implementations are missing. To improve safety-critical compliance, these areas must be addressed with explicit recover/retry or safe halt procedures.
