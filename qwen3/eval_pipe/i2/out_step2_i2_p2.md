1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code largely complies with MISRA-C 2012 Mandatory rules, showing appropriate use of named constants replacing magic numbers and careful type usage with explicit casts. However, it fails mandatory rules related to switch statements, single exit points in functions, and logical operators' side effects, partially due to the absence of switch statements or multiple return points. Some guidelines lack adequate evidence due to code structure or are not applicable but need explicit confirmation or modification. Overall, the implementation covers many safety aspects but requires revisions to fully meet all mandatory MISRA-C requirements.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.1: 적절한 operator 활용  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code uses explicit casts for type conversions (e.g., `(uint32_t)((walk_time - threshold) * 1000.0F)`), avoiding ambiguous operators and maintaining correct operation precedence and safety.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.3: 암묵적 타입 변환 제거  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Explicit casts are used when converting between types, especially float-to-uint32_t conversions for delay functions, preventing implicit conversions (e.g., `(uint32_t)(walk_time * 1000.0F)`).

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.4: 필수 타입 모델 준수  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code consistently uses standard fixed-width types like `int32_t`, `uint32_t`, and standard float literals (`0.1F`), aligning with required type models.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.1: 모든 switch문에 default 케이스 추가  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No switch statements are present in the code; thus, this rule is not applicable.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.4: 모든 경로에 break  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No switch statements exist in the code, so the requirement for break statements in every path is not applicable.

Guideline_Item: Rule 15.5: 함수는 단일 exit point (return문 하나)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The `setup()` function implicitly returns multiple times due to conditional processing in `if (spaceIndex != -1)` without a single return point. Although no explicit return statements are used, the exit points exist after conditional blocks. To comply, consolidate to a single explicit return at the end of `setup()`.

Guideline_Item: Rule 13.5: 논리 연산자 &&, || 의 우항에 부작용 금지  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No logical AND (&&) or OR (||) operators are used in the code; thus, no risk exists for side effects on the right-hand side expressions.

Guideline_Item: Rule 8.7: Magic number를 명명된 상수로 변경 (0, 1 제외)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Most magic numbers are replaced with named constants; however, literals such as `' '` (space character) and `'\n'`, `'\r'` character codes used in conditions are not replaced with named constants. According to MISRA, character constants can be defined as named constants for clarity and avoidance of magic values.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

A notable pattern is reliance on implicit code structure rather than explicit MISRA-required constructs. For instance, the absence of `switch` statements is valid but should be explicitly commented or structured to confirm no violations. The lack of single exit points in `setup()` may lead to maintainability concerns and should be revised with explicit single return statement. Also, the code does not define named constants for certain character literals that appear as magic numbers; defining them improves readability and compliance. No dangerous implicit type conversions or side effects in logical operators were observed, indicating sound handling of essential type and operator rules. Addressing the noted failures will improve both compliance and code robustness.
