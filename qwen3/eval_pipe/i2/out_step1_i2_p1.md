1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code demonstrates strong adherence to memory safety guidelines. It uses only static allocations for variables, correctly calculates and annotates stack usage for functions, performs explicit boundary checking on input buffers to prevent overflow, and limits global variables' scope via static declarations. However, minor issues remain with implicit buffer usage and lack of detailed boundary validation on numeric conversions, leading to one failure.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All global variables are declared static and local buffers (inputBuffer) are fixed-size arrays allocated on the stack.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Stack usage is explicitly calculated and commented for both setup() and loop() functions.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Comments explicitly indicate estimated stack usage bytes for both setup() and loop() functions at their start.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Although inputBuffer usage includes boundary checks to prevent overflow on character input, the numeric conversion using strtof() does not validate whether inputs are within expected numeric ranges or properly formatted, which may cause unexpected behavior or errors. A more robust numeric validation or input sanitization is required to fully meet boundary check standards.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All global variables are declared static, restricting their scope to the file, minimizing global namespace pollution.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The code demonstrates disciplined memory safety with static allocation and careful stack usage annotation. Buffer overflow risks are mitigated via fixed-size input buffers and explicit bounds checks on input reading loops. The use of static on all globals conforms well to best practices minimizing global state exposure.

The main weakness is the lack of thorough validation for the numeric input parsing after reading into the inputBuffer. Although buffer overflow is mitigated, improper or malicious input (e.g., alphabetic characters, multiple spaces, or overflowed floats) is not explicitly handled, which can cause run-time logical errors. Introducing numeric input validation or error handling after strtof() would improve robustness and fully satisfy boundary checking requirements.
