1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code demonstrates a structured error handling approach using an enumerated type ErrorCode consistently returned by all functions, which aligns well with the guideline requirements. Error propagation is explicit, and default values are established to maintain fail-safe behavior. However, the code does not explicitly distinguish between recoverable and fatal errors, and critical error handling paths could be more clearly documented or differentiated, resulting in partial non-compliance in that area.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 에러 코드 체계가 있다면 그것을 따르며 없다면 enum 사용하여 통일된 에러처리를 하도록 함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: ErrorCode enum is defined and used consistently throughout functions for error reporting, ensuring uniform error handling.

Guideline_Item: 모든 함수가 에러 상태를 반환함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions whose operations can fail return an ErrorCode value representing success or specific failure states.

Guideline_Item: 에러 전파 경로 명확  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function returns errors explicitly, and calling contexts check and propagate or handle these return values, demonstrating clear error propagation.

Guideline_Item: Fail safe하도록 기본값 설정  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Upon any initialization or parsing failure, default values (stop_time=30, walk_time=5) are set to maintain safe system operation.

Guideline_Item: 복구 가능한 에러와 치명적 에러 구분  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: The code does not explicitly differentiate recoverable errors from fatal errors; all errors seem handled uniformly without categorization or specific recovery strategies. To fix, implement error categories and handle them accordingly, for example, by retrying or halting operation on fatal errors.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

The use of the ErrorCode enum and its consistent application establishes a strong foundation for systematic error handling. The propagation of errors with explicit checks further ensures robust error awareness across function calls. The use of default values upon failure safeguards system stability, aligning with fail-safe principles. However, the absence of error severity levels or distinctions between recoverable and unrecoverable errors represents a gap that could impact the system's resilience and maintenance in the event of critical failures. Introducing explicit error classes or severity levels and designing differentiated handling logic would enhance compliance with the comprehensive error management guideline.
