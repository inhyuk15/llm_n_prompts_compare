1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code generally follows guidelines aimed at limiting code complexity; functions are well modularized, with most functions clearly under the 50-line limit and using fewer than 5 parameters. Cyclomatic complexity and nesting depth appear managed given the code's straightforward logic and absence of deep nesting. However, without explicit cyclomatic complexity metrics, the exact adherence to the "Cyclomatic Complexity 10 or less" guideline requires assumption based on visual inspection.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Cyclomatic complexity is not explicitly calculated or measured in the provided code. Visual inspection suggests low complexity, but exact adherence cannot be confirmed without metrics.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The code does not contain nested control structures exceeding 4 levels. The deepest nesting observed is within parseInput’s for-loop and if statement (2 levels), and loop’s if-else control structure is only 2 levels deep.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions are well below 50 lines. For example, `loop()`, `flashLED()`, and others are concise, with under 20 lines per function.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All functions have 0 to 2 parameters at most, e.g., readInput(char*, size_t), flashLED(int, uint32_t), complying with the ≤5 parameters requirement.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS  
- The code demonstrates good modularization, aiding readability and maintainability.  
- The lack of explicit cyclomatic complexity measurement may pose a risk of undiscovered complexity spikes, especially if future changes add control paths. Implementing cyclomatic complexity analysis (e.g., via static analysis tools) would strengthen compliance verification.  
- Nesting and parameter counts are well-controlled, which reduces risk of cognitive overload or maintenance cost.  
- The well-distributed single-purpose functions ensure that the code is manageable in size and complexity.  
- No violations were found that negatively impact maintainability or clarity per the given guidelines.
