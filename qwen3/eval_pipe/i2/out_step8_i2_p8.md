1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The code partially complies with the guideline on consistent formatting and naming rules. It applies consistent formatting throughout and uses descriptive naming. However, it is unclear whether a project-specific formatting and naming standard exists; if not, the Google C/C++ style must be applied, but the code follows a mixed naming convention that deviates from Google style's expectations for variable names (e.g., use of underscores in some but camelCase preferred). Thus, a definitive pass cannot be given without clarification on project rules.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 코드 작성시 일관된 formatting과 naming 규칙을 적용하세요  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: It is unclear from the provided information whether a project-specific formatting and naming convention exists. If none exists, Google C/C++ style should be applied, which prefers lower_case_with_underscores for variables and functions. The code mixes camelCase and snake_case (e.g., setupPins, setSolidLED, stop_time), leading to inconsistency per Google style. Clarification on project naming conventions or confirmation that Google style is expected is needed.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The code demonstrates generally consistent indentation and commenting style, suggesting some formatting discipline.
- Naming conventions are mixed:  
  - Functions use camelCase (e.g., setupPins, readInput).  
  - Variables use snake_case for globals like stop_time and walk_time, but also camelCase for others (e.g., thresholdMillis, delayMillis).  
  - Constants are in uppercase with underscores, which aligns with common C macros style.
- This mixture violates Google C/C++ style guidelines for naming, which prefer lower_case_with_underscores for variables and functions, making the code partially non-compliant if no project-specific rules override this.
- Since the guidelines allow project naming rules to override the Google style, but no project formatting/naming rules were provided, a review is necessary before passing or failing.  
- Potential risks include reduced readability and maintainability if inconsistent conventions confuse developers.  
- The code uses descriptive names, making the intent clear, which is a strength.
- To fix any non-compliance under Google style, rename variables and functions to consistent lower_case_with_underscores style (e.g., noInterrupts → no_interrupts; stop_time → stop_time; setSolidLED → set_solid_led).

In conclusion, confirmation of the applicable project formatting and naming guidelines is required to determine full compliance.
