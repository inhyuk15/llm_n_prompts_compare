1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code largely adheres to the guidelines of memory safety, MISRA-C 2012 mandatory rules, and complexity constraints. Static allocation is used extensively for buffers and RTOS objects, avoiding dynamic allocation except commented in initialization. Boundary checks prevent buffer overflow in input handling. The code implements switch statements with default cases and single exit points for functions, and uses named constants in place of magic numbers. Cyclomatic complexity and nesting depth appear controlled, and large functions are split logically. However, some minor MISRA violations, missing comments on stack size, and incomplete static allocation of queues and semaphores reduce full compliance. Overall, the code is robust and mostly aligned with prescribed requirements.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: In Calculator_Init, xQueueCreateStatic and xSemaphoreCreateCountingStatic are called with NULL pointers for buffer, which effectively disables truly static allocation; also a call to pvPortMalloc is commented but logically incorrect; thus dynamic or missing static buffer allocation exists.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야하며 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Task stack size is defined and commented but individual functions lack comments indicating stack usage estimation; no explicit per-function stack usage or any calculation annotations are present in function headers.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: AppendDigit limits input_length < MAX_INPUT_LENGTH before writing input_buffer; FormatFixedPoint checks buffer size; KeypadTask ensures display buffer writes within bounds; input conversions carefully handle length constraints.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All global variables are declared static with limited scope; only necessary variables are global; no unscoped globals present.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.1, 10.3, 10.4 - 암묵적 타입 변환 제거, 필수 타입 모델 준수  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Explicit casts exist where needed; integral types used consistently; no implicit widening or narrowing detected; all constants use U suffix; int32_t and uint32_t used appropriately.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.1, 16.4 - 모든 switch문에 default 케이스 추가, 모든 경로에 break  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All switch statements (PerformCalculation, KeypadTask key switch) include default cases; all cases terminate with break; no fall-through without break.

Guideline_Item: Rule 15.5 - 함수는 단일 exit point (return문 하나)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Multiple functions (DivideQ16, PerformCalculation, InputBufferToQ16) contain multiple return points, violating single exit point rule.

Guideline_Item: Rule 13.5 - 논리 연산자 &&, || 의 우항에 부작용 금지  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Logical expressions do not contain side effects on their right-hand side; conditions are safe and consistently written.

Guideline_Item: Rule 8.7 - Magic number를 명명된 상수로 변경 (0, 1 제외)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All magic numbers except 0 and 1 are replaced with named constants; keypad keys defined as enum; shift amounts and sizes defined via macros.

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions are divided logically and do not exceed high complexity; switch statements manageable; no large monolithic functions.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Maximum nesting of code blocks is four levels or less throughout code; complex conditionals are flattened or limited.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Each function appears well under 50 lines; modular design evident.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No function receives more than 5 parameters.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량 주석 명시  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: No functions have explicit comments specifying calculated stack usage. Only TASK_STACK_SIZE macro is commented.

Guideline_Item: MISRA Rule 15.5 single exit — consistency across all functions  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Several functions use early returns breaking single exit point rule; e.g., InputBufferToQ16, DivideQ16, PerformCalculation.

Guideline_Item: Static allocation of synchronization primitives correctly done  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: The queue and semaphore are created with *Static functions but buffers passed are NULL; Pointers should link to statically allocated memory structures, which are missing; thus actual static allocation is ambiguous.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The main systemic issue across guidelines is partial or incorrect static allocation for RTOS queues and semaphores; while *Static API variants are used, associated buffers (static arrays) are missing, which risks dynamic allocation or failure inconsistent with guideline demands.

- Multiple returns per function violate mandatory MISRA Rule 15.5; refactoring to have a single exit point is needed for full compliance.

- Stack usage comments are only present for the task stack array, not for any function; detailed stack usage estimation or annotations should be added per function.

- Despite strong boundary checks for input buffers and display buffers preventing overflow risks, continuous enforcement of sizes and proper static allocation buffers for RTOS objects is required.

- Logical operations and type conversions are well handled, with explicit casts and no side-effect misuse in conditions.

- Named constants have replaced all magic numbers appropriately, except 0 and 1 as allowed.

- Code complexity is well controlled with small, maintainable functions and constrained nesting depths.

Overall, the code is strong in design and safety aspects but requires fixes in static allocation of RTOS primitives and strict MISRA single-exit rule adherence, plus added documentation comments on stack sizing.

# Final Note

To fix partial static allocation of queue and semaphore:

- Declare static buffers with proper sizes for queue storage (e.g., static uint8_t xQueueStorageArea[queue_length * sizeof(uint8_t)];) and provide pointers to these buffers in xQueueCreateStatic.

- Similarly, declare and link static SemaphoreBuffer_t variables for semaphore creation.

To fix single exit points:

- Refactor functions with multiple returns into a single return by using status variables and goto/cleanup labels or structured control flow.

To fix stack usage comments:

- Add per-function comments specifying calculated stack consumption based on local variables and call stack requirements.
