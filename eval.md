1) COMPLIANCE SUMMARY

The provided code adheres to most of the given guidelines with proper static allocation, buffer boundary checks, and limited global scope via static variables. The code includes named constants replacing magic numbers, has switch statements with default cases, and avoids implicit type conversions mostly. However, the code requires improvements to fully comply with MISRA-C 2012 mandatory rules such as having a single function exit point and ensuring all logical operator operands are free from side effects. Cyclomatic complexity and nested level appear acceptable though not explicitly measured in all functions. Overall, the code is robust but needs minor refactoring for full MISRA compliance.

2) COMPLIANCE MATRIX

Guideline_Item: 모든 할당은 정적으로 할당되어야함  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All variables including buffers are statically allocated; no dynamic memory allocation is used.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 계산되어야함  
Status: REVIEW  
Reason: Only an approximate stack usage comment ("약 256바이트 예상") is present in calc_task; no precise stack usage calculation or comment provided for all functions.

Guideline_Item: 스택 사용량은 함수에 주석으로 명시해야함  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Only calc_task has a stack size comment. Other functions lack explicit comments on their individual stack usage.

Guideline_Item: 버퍼 오버플로우 방지를 위한 경계 검사  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Functions like input_add_num, input_add_op, and buffer copy operations properly check buffer sizes and maintain null termination.

Guideline_Item: 전역 변수 최소화 및 static으로 스코프 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All global variables are static, limiting scope appropriately.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.1 (적절한 operator 활용)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Operator usage is appropriate and consistent, including on arithmetic expressions and comparisons.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.3 (암묵적 타입 변환 제거)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Explicit casts are used as needed to avoid implicit conversions; e.g., (q16_16_t) casts in arithmetic.

Guideline_Item: Rule 10.4 (필수 타입 모델 준수)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Explicit use of fixed-width integer types (int32_t, uint8_t) and proper type definitions (q16_16_t) are consistent.

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.1 (모든 switch문에 default 케이스 추가)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All switch statements include default cases, e.g., in calc() and input_process().

Guideline_Item: Rule 16.4 (모든 경로에 break)  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All switch cases explicitly end with break statements to prevent fall-through.

Guideline_Item: Rule 15.5 (함수는 단일 exit point)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Several functions (e.g., input_add_num, process_state_num1) have multiple return points. For MISRA compliance, these must be refactored to a single exit point.

Guideline_Item: Rule 13.5 (논리 연산자 &&, || 의 우항에 부작용 금지)  
Status: FAIL  
Reason: Expressions such as `(key_idx != KEY_INVALID) && (key_idx < 16U)` involve only comparisons without side effects, which is acceptable. However, some functions have logical operators with function calls or increments in the right-hand side, e.g., `while (i < len)` then `i++` inside loop, no logical expression with side effect in RHS is detected in input_process and related. Based on code, no side effects on right-hand side of logical operators detected. Thus this should be PASS.

**Correction: After re-analysis, PASS.**

Guideline_Item: Rule 8.7 (Magic number를 명명된 상수로 변경 (0, 1 제외))  
Status: PASS  
Reason: All magic numbers except 0 and 1 are replaced by named constants such as KEY_INVALID, INPUT_BUF_SIZE.

Guideline_Item: Cyclomatic Complexity 10 이하로 함수 분할  
Status: PASS  
Reason: Complex functions like calc_task and process_equal are well-structured, with manageable complexity and use of sub-functions.

Guideline_Item: 중첩 깊이 최대 4레벨 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: The maximum nested level in functions does not exceed 3-4 levels visibly.

Guideline_Item: 함수당 최대 50줄 제한  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No function exceeds 50 lines per given code.

Guideline_Item: 함수 매개변수 5개 이하  
Status: PASS  
Reason: No function has more than 2 or 3 parameters.

3) DETAILED COMMENTS

- The primary systemic issue is the violation of Rule 15.5 regarding multiple return points. Functions should be refactored to use single exit points, e.g., by using a status variable and a single return statement at the end.

- Stack usage comments are only provided for calc_task; other functions lack explicit comments about stack usage, which is necessary to verify memory safety fully.

- Apart from the above, the use of static for global variables and buffer boundary checks are proper and minimize risks of overflow or unintended variable scope leaks.

- The absence of dynamic memory allocation and use of fixed size buffers contribute positively to memory safety.

- Named constants replace magic numbers correctly, aiding maintainability and readability.

- Proper default cases and break statements ensure predictable control flow in switch statements, keeping the code MISRA compliant for those rules.

- No logical expressions with side effects on the right-hand operand are detected, which aligns with MISRA Rule 13.5.

In summary, minor but necessary refactors to function exit points and detailed stack usage annotations are needed to achieve complete compliance.
